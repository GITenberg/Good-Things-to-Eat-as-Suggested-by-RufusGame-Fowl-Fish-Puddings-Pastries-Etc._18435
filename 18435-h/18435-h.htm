<h2>FOREWORD</h2>


<div class="figleft"><img src="images/img004.jpg" alt="Ornamental 'T'" title="Ornamental 'T'" /></div><p>hat the average parent is blind to the faults of its offspring is a
fact so obvious that in attempting to prove or controvert it time and
logic are both wasted. Ill temper in a child is, alas! too often
mistaken for an indication of genius; and impudence is sometimes
regarded as a sign of precocity. The author, however, has honestly
striven to avoid this common prejudice. This book, the child of his
brain, and experience, extending over a long period of time and varying
environment, he frankly admits is not without its faults&mdash;is far from
perfect; but he is satisfied that, notwithstanding its apparent
shortcomings, it will serve in a humble way some useful purpose.</p>

<p>The recipes given in the following pages represent the labor of years.
Their worth has been demonstrated, not experimentally, but by actual
tests, day by day and month by month, under dissimilar, and, in many
instances, not too favorable conditions.</p>

<p>One of the pleasures in life to the normal man is good eating, and if it
be true that real happiness consists in making others happy, the author
can at least feel a sense of gratification in the thought that his
attempts to satisfy the cravings of the inner man have not been wholly
unappreciated by the many that he has had the pleasure of serving&mdash;some
of whom are now his stanchest friends. In fact, it was in response to
the insistence and encouragement of these friends that he embarked in
the rather hazardous undertaking of offering this collection to a
discriminating public.</p>

<p>To snatch from his daily toil a few moments, here and there, in order to
arrange with some degree of symmetry, not the delicacies that would
awaken the jaded appetite of the gourmet, but to prepare an ensemble
that might, with equal grace, adorn the home table or banquet board, has
proven a task of no mean proportions. Encouraged by his friends,
however, he persevered and this volume is the results of his effort.</p>

<p>If, when gathered around the festal board, in camp or by fireside, on
train or ship, "trying out" the recipes, his friends will pause,
retrospectively, and with kindly feelings think from whence some of the
good things emanated, the author will feel amply compensated for the
care, the thought, the labor he has expended in the preparation of the
book; and to those friends, individually and collectively, it is
therefore dedicated.</p>

<h2>SKETCH OF MY LIFE</h2>


<p>I was born in Murray County, Tennessee, in 1857, a slave. I was given
the name of my master, D. J. Estes, who owned my mother's family,
consisting of seven boys and two girls, I being the youngest of the
family.</p>

<p>After the war broke out all the male slaves in the neighborhood for
miles around ran off and joined the "Yankees." This left us little folks
to bear the burdens. At the age of five I had to carry water from the
spring about a quarter of a mile from the house, drive the cows to and
from the pastures, mind the calves, gather chips, etc.</p>

<p>In 1867 my mother moved to Nashville, Tennessee, my grandmother's home,
where I attended one term of school. Two of my brothers were lost in the
war, a fact that wrecked my mother's health somewhat and I thought I
could be of better service to her and prolong her life by getting work.
When summer came I got work milking cows for some neighbors, for which I
got two dollars a month. I also carried hot dinners for the laborers in
the fields, for which each one paid me twenty-five cents per month. All
of this, of course, went to my mother. I worked at different places
until I was sixteen years old, but long before that time I was taking
care of my mother.</p>

<p>At the age of sixteen I was employed in Nashville by a restaurant-keeper
named Hemphill. I worked there until I was twenty-one years of age. In
1881 I came to Chicago and got a position at 77 Clark Street, where I
remained for two years at a salary of ten dollars a week.</p>

<p>In 1883 I entered the Pullman service, my first superintendent being J.
P. Mehen. I remained in their service until 1897. During the time I was
in their service some of the most prominent people in the world traveled
in the car assigned to me, as I was selected to handle all special
parties. Among the distinguished people who traveled in my care were
Stanley, the African explorer; President Cleveland; President Harrison;
Adelina Patti, the noted singer of the world at that time; Booth and
Barrett; Modjeski and Paderewski. I also had charge of the car for
Princess Eulalie of Spain, when she was the guest of Chicago during the
World's Fair.</p>

<p>In 1894 I set sail from Vancouver on the Empress of China with Mr. and
Mrs. Nathan A. Baldwin for Japan, visiting the Cherry Blossom Festival
at Tokio.</p>

<p>In 1897 Mr. Arthur Stillwell, at that time president of the Kansas City,
Pittsburg &amp; Gould Railroad, gave me charge of his magnificent $20,000
private car. I remained with him seventeen months when the road went
into the hands of receivers, and the car was sold to John W. Gates
syndicate. However, I had charge of the car under the new management
until 1907, since which time I have been employed as chef of the
subsidiary companies of the United States Steel Corporation in Chicago.</p>

<h2>HINTS TO KITCHEN MAIDS</h2>


<p>It is always necessary to keep your kitchen in the best condition.</p>

<p><b>Breakfast</b>&mdash;If a percolator is used it should first be put into
operation. If the breakfast consists of grapefruit, cereals, etc., your
cereal should be the next article prepared. If there is no diningroom
maid, you can then put your diningroom in order. If hot bread is to be
served (including cakes) that is the next thing to be prepared. Your gas
range is of course lighted, and your oven heated. Perhaps you have for
breakfast poached eggs on toast, Deerfoot sausage or boiled ham. One of
the above, with your other dishes, is enough for a person employed
indoors.</p>

<p>When your breakfast gong is sounded put your biscuits, eggs, bread,
etc., in the oven so that they may be ready to serve when the family
have eaten their grapefruit and cereal.</p>

<p><b>Luncheon</b>&mdash;This is the easiest meal of the three to prepare.
Yesterday's dinner perhaps consisted of roast turkey, beef or lamb, and
there is some meat left over; then pick out one of my receipts calling
for minced or creamed meats; baked or stuffed potatoes are always nice,
or there may be cold potatoes left over that can be mashed, made into
cakes and fried.</p>

<p><b>Dinner</b>&mdash;For a roast beef dinner serve vegetable soup as the first
course, with a relish of vegetables in season and horseradish or
chow-chow pickle, unless you serve salad.</p>

<p>If quail or ducks are to be served for dinner, an old Indian dish, wild
rice, is very desirable. Prepare this rice as follows:</p>

<p>Place in a double boiler a cupful of milk or cream to each cupful of
rice and add salt and pepper to taste. It requires a little longer to
cook than the ordinary rice, but must not be stirred. If it becomes dry
add a little milk from time to time.</p>

<p>Do not serve dishes at the same meal that conflict. For instance, if you
have sliced tomatoes, do not serve tomato soup. If, however, you have
potato soup, it would not be out of place to serve potatoes with your
dinner.</p>

<p>Fish should never be served without a salad of some kind.</p>

<p>The above are merely suggestions that have been of material assistance
to me.</p>

<h2>GOOD THINGS TO EAT<br /><br /><br /></h2>

<h2>SOUPS</h2>


<p><b>ASPARAGUS SOUP</b>&mdash;Take three pounds of knuckle of veal and put it to
boil in a gallon of water with a couple of bunches of asparagus, boil
for three hours, strain, and return the juice to the pot. Add another
bunch of asparagus, chopped fine, and boil for twenty minutes, mix a
tablespoonful of flour in a cup of milk and add to the soup. Season with
salt and pepper, let it come to a boil, and serve at once.</p>


<p><b>BEAN SOUP</b>&mdash;One-half pound or one cup is sufficient for one quart of
soup. Soups can be made which use milk or cream as basis. Any kind of
green vegetable can be used with them, as creamed celery or creamed
cauliflower. The vegetable is cooked and part milk and part water or
part milk and part cream are used.</p>


<p><b>BISQUE OF CLAMS</b>&mdash;Place a knuckle of veal, weighing about a pound and
one-half, into a soup kettle, with a quart of water, one small onion, a
sprig of parsley, a bay leaf, and the liquor drained from the clams, and
simmer gradually for an hour and a half, skimming from time to time;
strain the soup and again place it in the kettle; rub a couple of
tablespoonfuls of butter with an equal amount of flour together and add
it to the soup when it is boiling, stirring until again boiling; chop up
twenty-five clams very fine, then place them in the soup, season and
boil for about five minutes, then add a pint of milk or cream, and
remove from the fire immediately, and serve.</p>


<p><b>BISQUE OF LOBSTER</b>&mdash;Remove the meat of the lobster from its shell and
cut the tender pieces into quarter-inch dice; put the ends of the
claw-meat and any tough portions in a saucepan with the bones of the
body and a little cold water and boil for twenty minutes, adding a
little water from time to time as may be necessary; put the coral to dry
in a moderate oven, and mix a little flour with some cold milk, and stir
the milk, which should be boiling, stirring over the fire for ten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
minutes, then strain the water from the bones and other parts, mix it
with milk, add a little butter, salt, pepper and cayenne to taste, and
rub the dry coral through a fine-haired sieve, putting enough into the
soup having it a bright pink color. Place the grease fat and lobster
dice in a soup tureen, strain the boiling soup over them, and serve at
once.</p>


<p><b>BISQUE OF OYSTERS</b>&mdash;Place about thirty medium-sized oysters in a
saucepan together with their own juice and poach them over a hot fire,
after which drain well; then fry a shallot colorless in some butter,
together with an onion, sprinkle over them a little curry and add some
of the oyster juice, seasoning with salt and red pepper. Pound the
oysters to a good firm paste, moistening them with a little of their
juice, and strain through fine tammy cloth. Warm them over the fire, but
do not let them boil; add a small quantity of thickening of potato flour
mixed with a little water. When about to serve incorporate some cream
and fine butter, garnishing with some chopped oysters and mushrooms,
mixed with breadcrumbs and herbs. Add a little seasoning of salt, pepper
and nutmeg, some raw egg yolks, and roll this mixture into ball-shape
pieces, place them on a well-buttered baking sheet in a slack oven and
poach them, then serve.</p>


<p><b>BLACK BEAN SOUP</b>&mdash;Wash one pint of black beans, cover with one quart of
cold water and let soak over night. In the morning pour off the water
and pour over three pints of cold water. Cook, covered, until tender,
four or five hours, add one tablespoonful of salt the last hour, rub
through a strainer, add the strained beans to the water in which they
were boiled, return to the soup kettle. Melt one tablespoonful of flour,
stir this into the hot soup, let boil, stirring constantly; add a little
pepper, slice thinly one lemon, put all the slices into the tureen and
pour the soup over. Serve very hot.</p>


<p><b>CHESTNUT SOUP</b>&mdash;Peel and blanch the chestnuts, boil them in salted
water until quite soft, pass through a sieve, add more water if too
thick, and a spoonful of butter or several of sweet cream. Season to
taste and serve with small squares of bread fried crisp in butter or
olive oil.</p>


<p><b>CHICKEN GUMBO, CREOLE STYLE</b>&mdash;For about twelve or fifteen, one young
hen chicken, half pound ham, quart fresh okra, three large tomatoes, two
onions, one kernel garlic, one small red pepper, two tablespoons flour,
three quarts boiling water, half pound butter, one bay leaf, pinch salt
and cayenne<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> pepper. To mix, mince your ham, put in the bottom of an
iron kettle if preferred with the above ingredients except the chicken.
Clean and cut your chicken up and put in separate saucepan with about a
quart or more of water and teaspoonful of salt; set to the side of the
fire for about an hour; skim when necessary. When the chicken is
thoroughly done strip the meat from the bone and mix both together; just
before serving add a quart of shrimps.</p>


<p><b>CREAM OF CELERY SOUP</b>&mdash;Chop fine one head of celery and put on to cook
in one pint of water. Boil until tender, add one pint of milk, thicken
with a spoonful of butter, season to taste, and strain. Then add one
cupful of whipped cream and serve at once.</p>


<p><b>EGG SOUP</b>&mdash;Beat three eggs until light, then add one-half cupful of
thick sweet cream and one cupful of milk, pour over this two quarts of
boiling water, set on the fire until it comes to a boil, season to
taste, then pour over broken bread in the tureen and serve.</p>


<p><b>GREEN PEA SOUP</b>&mdash;Put one quart of green peas into two cups of boiling
water, add a saltspoon of salt, and cook until tender. Rub peas and
liquor through a puree strainer, add two cups of boiling water, and set
back where the pulp will keep hot. Heat two cups of milk, add a teaspoon
of flour rubbed into a rounding tablespoon of butter, season with salt,
pepper, and a level teaspoon of sugar. Add to the hot vegetable pulp,
heat to the boiling point, and serve.</p>


<p><b>GREEN TOMATO SOUP</b>&mdash;Chop fine five green tomatoes and boil twenty
minutes in water to cover. Then add one quart hot milk, to which a
teaspoonful soda has been added, let come to a boil, take from the fire
and add a quarter cupful butter rubbed into four crackers rolled fine,
with salt and pepper to taste.</p>


<p><b>ONION SOUP</b>&mdash;Cut three onions small, put one-quarter cup of butter in a
kettle and toast one tablespoon flour till bright yellow in color; in it
mix with this the onions, pour on as much broth as is wanted, add a
little mace and let boil, then strain, allow to cook a little longer,
add yolk of two eggs, and serve.</p>


<p><b>PEANUT SOUP</b>&mdash;Made like a dry pea soup. Soak a pint and one-half nut
meats over night in two quarts of water. In the morning add three quarts
of water, bay-leaf, stalk of celery, blade of mace and one slice of
onion. Boil slowly for four or five hours, stirring frequently to keep
from burning. Rub through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> a sieve and return to the fire, when heated
through again add one cupful of cream. Serve hot with croutons.</p>


<p><b>SAGO SOUP</b>&mdash;Wash one-half cup sago in warm water, add desired amount of
boiling broth (meat or chicken), a little mace, and cook until the sago
is soft, and serve.</p>


<p><b>SALMON SOUP</b>&mdash;Take the skin and bones from canned salmon and drain off
the oil. Chop fine enough of the fish to measure two-thirds of a cup.
Cook a thick slice of onion in a quart of milk twenty minutes in a
double boiler. Thicken with one-quarter cup of flour rubbed smooth with
one rounding tablespoonful of butter. Cook ten minutes, take out the
onion, add a saltspoon of pepper, one level teaspoon of salt and the
salmon. Rub all through a fine strainer, and serve hot. The amount of
salmon may be varied according to taste.</p>


<p><b>SORREL SOUP</b>&mdash;Wash thoroughly a pint of sorrel leaves and put in a
saucepan with two tablespoonfuls of butter, four or five of the large
outside leaves, a sliced onion, and a few small sprigs of parsley. Toss
over the fire for a few minutes, then sift into the pan two
tablespoonfuls of flour and stir until blended with the butter
remaining. Transfer to the soup kettle and pour in gradually, stirring
all the time, three quarts of boiling water. Cook gently for fifteen or
twenty minutes, then add a cupful of mashed potato and one of hot milk.
Season with salt, pepper and a little nutmeg. Have in the soup tureen
some croutons of bread toasted brown, pour the hot soup over them and
serve. The sorrel should be cut in fine pieces before cooking. This is
one of the delicacies of the early spring, its slightly acid flavor
making it particularly appetizing.</p>


<p><b>TOMATO SOUP</b>&mdash;Put one quart can of tomatoes, two cups of water,
one-half level tablespoon of sugar, one level teaspoon of salt, four
whole cloves, and four peppercorns together in a saucepan and simmer
twenty minutes. Fry a rounding tablespoon of chopped onion and half as
much minced parsley in a rounding tablespoon of butter until yellow, add
two level tablespoons of cornstarch. Stir until smooth, then turn into
the boiling soup and simmer ten minutes. Add more salt and pepper and
strain.</p>


<p><b>TOMATO SOUP</b>&mdash;Into a saucepan put one quart can of tomatoes and two
cups of broth from soup bones. To make this cover the bones and meat
with cold water and simmer slowly for several hours. Add to tomato and
stock a bit of bay leaf, one stalk celery cut in pieces, six
peppercorns, a level teaspoon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> of salt and a rounding teaspoon of sugar.
Cook slowly until tomato is soft. Meanwhile put a rounding tablespoon of
butter in a small saucepan and when melted and hot turn in a
medium-sized onion cut fine. When this has cooked slowly until yellow,
but not browned, add enough of the tomato to dilute it, then turn all
back into the larger saucepan. Mix and press through a strainer to take
out the seeds and bits of vegetables, reheat, and serve with small
croutons.</p>


<p><b>TOMATO SOUP, CORNED BEEF STOCK</b>&mdash;Put one quart can tomatoes on to boil,
add six peppercorns, one-half inch blade of mace and a bit of bay leaf
the same size. Fry one sliced onion in one level tablespoonful butter or
beef fat until slightly colored, add this to the tomato, and simmer
until the tomato is quite soft, and the liquor reduced one-half. Stir in
one-fourth teaspoon of soda, and when it stops foaming turn into a puree
strainer and rub the pulp through. Put the strained tomato on to boil
again and add an equal amount of corned beef liquor, or enough to make
three pints in all.</p>

<p>Melt one heaped tablespoon butter in a smooth saucepan, add one heaped
tablespoon cornstarch, and gradually add part of the boiling soup. Stir
as it thickens, and when smooth stir this into the remainder of the
soup. Add one teaspoon salt and one-fourth teaspoon paprika. Reserve one
pint of this soup to use with spaghetti. Serve buttered and browned
crackers with the soup.</p>


<p><b>VEGETABLE BROTH</b>&mdash;Take turnips, carrots, potatoes, beets, celery, all,
or two or three, and chop real fine. Then mix with them an equal amount
of cold water, put in a kettle, just bring to a boil, not allowing it to
boil for about three or four hours, and then drain off the water. The
flavor will be gone from the vegetables and will be in the broth.</p>


<p>VEGETABLE SOUP&mdash;Take one-half a turnip, two carrots, three potatoes,
three onions and a little cabbage. Run through a meat chopper with
coarse cutter and put to cook in cold water. Cook about three hours. If
you wish you can put a little bit of cooking oil in. When cooked add one
quart of tomatoes. This will need about six quarts of water.</p>

<p>The most nutritious soups are made from peas and beans.</p>


<p><b>VEGETABLE SOUP</b> (without stock)&mdash;One-half cup each of carrot and
turnip, cut into small pieces, three-fourths cup of celery, cut fine,
one very small onion sliced thin, four level tablespoons of butter,
three-fourths cup of potato, cut into small dice,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> one and one-half
quarts of boiling water, salt and pepper to taste. Prepare the
vegetables and cook the carrot, celery and onion in the butter for ten
minutes without browning. Add the potato and cook for three minutes
longer, then add the water and cook slowly for one hour. Rub through a
sieve, add salt and pepper to taste, and a little butter if desired.</p>


<p><b>WHITE SOUP</b>&mdash;Put six pounds of lean gravy beef into a saucepan, with
half gallon of water and stew gently until all the good is extracted and
remove beef. Add to the liquor six pounds of knuckle of veal, one-fourth
pound ham, four onions, four heads of celery, cut into small pieces, a
few peppercorns and bunch of sweet herbs. Stew gently for seven or eight
hours, skimming off the fat as it rises to the top. Mix with the crumbs
of two French rolls two ounces of blanched sweet almonds and put in a
saucepan with a pint of cream and a little stock, boil ten minutes, then
pass through a silk sieve, using a wooden spoon in the process. Mix the
cream and almonds with the soup, turn into a tureen, and serve.</p>


<p><b>WINE SOUP</b>&mdash;Put the yolks of twelve eggs and whites of six in an
enameled saucepan and beat thoroughly. Pour in one and a half breakfast
cupfuls of water, add six ounces of loaf sugar, the grated rind and
strained juice of a large lemon, one and one-half pints of white wine.
Whisk the soup over a gentle fire until on the point of boiling,
removing immediately. Turn into a tureen, and serve with a plate of
sponge cakes or fancy biscuits. (This soup should be served as soon as
taken from fire.)</p>


<p><b>CHESTNUT SOUP</b>&mdash;Peel and blanch the chestnuts, boil them in salted
water until quite soft, pass through a sieve, add more water if too
thick, and a spoonful of butter or several of sweet cream, season to
taste, and serve with small squares of bread fried crisp in butter or
olive oil.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="FISH" id="FISH"></a>FISH</h2>


<p><b>BOILED CODFISH, WITH CREAM SAUCE</b>&mdash;Take out the inside of a cod by the
white skin of the belly, taking care to remove all blood. Place the fish
in a kettle with salted cold water; boil fast at first, then slowly.
When done take out and skin. Pour over it a sauce made as follows:</p>

<p>One-fourth pound butter put into a stewpan with one tablespoonful of
flour, moistened with one pint of cream or rich milk, and salt and
pepper, and also one teaspoonful essence of anchovies. Place the pan
over the fire and let thicken, but not boil.</p>


<p><b>BOILED MACKEREL</b>&mdash;Prepare and clean some mackerel. Put in water and
boil until they are done. When cooked, drain and put the mackerel on a
hot dish. Blanch some fennel in salted water. When it is soft drain and
chop finely. Put one tablespoonful in half pint of butter sauce. Serve
in a sauce boat with the fish.</p>


<p><b>BOILED SALMON WITH SAUCE TARTARE</b>&mdash;Scrape the skin of the fish, wipe,
and if you have no regular fish kettle with a perforated lid, tie in a
piece of cheesecloth and place gently in a kettle of boiling salted
water. Push the kettle back on the fire (where it will simmer gently,
instead of boiling hard) and cook, allowing about six minutes to the
pound. Remove carefully, drain, and chill. If the fish breaks and looks
badly take out the bones, flake, pile lightly on the platter and pour
the sauce over it. This may be a hot sauce Hollandaise or a cold sauce
tartare.</p>


<p><b>BROILED MACKEREL</b>&mdash;Draw and wash the mackerel. Cut off heads and rub
over with salt and leave for an hour. Rub a gridiron with olive oil, lay
the mackerel on it and broil over a charcoal fire. Place some chopped
parsley and onions on a hot dish, with the hot fish, squeezing over the
mackerel a little lemon juice. Serve hot.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>


<p><b>BROILED MACKEREL, WITH BLACK BUTTER</b>&mdash;Take some mackerel, open and
remove bones. Season with butter, pepper, and salt. Place the fish on a
gridiron and broil over a clear fire. Put a part of the butter in a
saucepan and stir it over the fire until it is richly browned, squeezing
into it a little lemon juice. Place the fish on a hot dish, arrange some
sprigs of parsley around it, and pour over it the butter sauce, and
serve hot.</p>


<p><b>CODFISH CONES</b>&mdash;When it is not convenient to make and fry fish balls
try this substitute. Pick enough salt codfish into shreds to measure two
cups and let stand in cold water for two or more hours, then drain dry.
Make a sauce from one cup of hot milk, two level tablespoons each of
flour and butter, and cook five minutes. Mash and season enough hot
boiled potatoes to measure two cups, add the sauce and the fish and beat
well with a fork. Shape in small cones, set on a butter pan, brush with
melted butter and scatter fine bread crumbs over. Set in oven to brown.</p>


<p><b>CODFISH HASH</b>&mdash;Take a cup of cooked cod, pick in pieces and soak in
cold water for twelve hours. Boil some potatoes and add them to the
finely chopped fish, a little at a time. Put in a saucepan with some
butter and stir. Let it cook gently.</p>


<p><b>FINNAN HADDIE FISH CAKES</b>&mdash;The finnan haddie parboiled with an equal
quantity of mashed potatoes, season with melted butter, salt and pepper,
add a beaten egg, and mold into cakes.</p>


<p><b>FISH, EAST INDIA STYLE</b>&mdash;Peel two medium-sized onions, cut into thin
slices. Put in a stewpan with a small lump of butter and fry until
lightly browned. Pour over them some white stock, judging the quantity
by that of the fish; one ounce of butter, little curry powder, salt,
lemon juice, a little sugar, and cayenne pepper. Boil the stock for
fifteen or twenty minutes, then strain into a stewpan, skim and put in
the fish, having it carefully prepared. Boil gently, without breaking
the fish. Wash and boil half a cup of rice in water, and when cooked it
should be dried and the grains unbroken. Turn the curry out on a hot
dish, garnish with croutons of fried bread. Serve hot, with the rice in
separate dish.</p>


<p><b>FISH EN CASSEROLE</b>&mdash;One of those earthen baking dishes with
close-fitting cover of the same ware and fit for placing on the table is
especially useful for cooking fish. For instance, take two pounds of the
thick part of cod or haddock, both<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> of which are cheap fish. Take off
the skin and lay in the casserole. Make a sauce from two cups of milk
heated, with a good slice of onion, a rounding tablespoon of minced
parsley, a small piece of mace, a few gratings of the yellow rind of
lemon, half a level teaspoon of salt, and a little white pepper. Cook in
the top of a double boiler for twenty minutes. Heat one-quarter cup of
butter in a saucepan, add three level tablespoons of flour, and cook
smooth, turn on the hot milk after straining out the seasonings. Cook
until thick and pour over the fish. Cover and bake half hour, then if
the fish is done serve in the same dish with little finely minced
parsley scattered over.</p>


<p><b>LOUISIANA COD</b>&mdash;Melt one-quarter cup of butter and let it begin to
color, add two level tablespoons of flour and stir until smooth. Add one
cup of water and cook five minutes. Add half a level teaspoon of salt,
half as much pepper, and a teaspoon of lemon juice. Chop fine one
medium-size onion and one small green pepper, after taking out the
seeds. Brown them in two tablespoons of butter, add one cup of strained
tomatoes, a bit of bay leaf, and the prepared sauce. Put slices of cod
cut an inch thick into a casserole, pour on the sauce, cover closely,
and bake in a slow oven three-quarters of an hour.</p>


<p><b>METELOTE OF HADDOCK</b>&mdash;Wash and skin the haddock and remove the flesh
from the bones in firm pieces suitable for serving. Put the head, bones
and trimmings to cook in cold water and add a small sliced onion and
salt and pepper. Boil six good-sized onions until tender, then drain and
slice and put half of them into a buttered baking dish. Arrange the
pieces of fish on these, sprinkle with salt and pepper, then add the
remaining onions. Drain the fish from the trimmings, add to it two
tablespoons lemon juice and pour it over onions and fish. Cover very
closely and cook in the oven until the fish is tender. Then drain off
the liquid, heat it to the boiling point, and thicken it with two eggs
slightly beaten and diluted with a little of the hot liquid. Arrange the
onions on a hot platter and place the fish on top, then pour over the
thickened liquid.</p>


<p><b>A MOLD OF SALMON</b>&mdash;If where one cannot get fresh fish, the canned
salmon makes a delicious mold. Serve very cold on a bed of crisp lettuce
or cress. Drain off the juice from a can of salmon, and flake, picking
out every fragment of bone and skin. Mix with the fish one egg lightly
beaten, the juice of a half lemon, a cup fine dry bread crumbs, and salt
and pepper to season. Pack in a buttered mold which has a tight-fitting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
tin cover, steam for two hours, and cool. After it gets quite cold set
on the ice until ready to carve.</p>


<p><b>OYSTERS A LA POULETTE</b>&mdash;One quart oysters, four level tablespoons
butter, four level tablespoons flour, one-half level teaspoon salt,
one-fourth level teaspoon celery salt, one-half cup oysters liquor, one
cup each of chicken stock and milk, juice one-half lemon. Look over the
oysters, heat quickly to the boiling point, then drain and strain the
liquor through cheesecloth. Melt the butter, add the flour, salt and
celery salt, and when blended add the oyster liquor, chicken stock and
milk, stirring until thick and smooth. Cook for five minutes, then add
the oysters and lemon juice, and serve at once.</p>


<p><b>OYSTER FRICASSE</b>&mdash;Put one pint of oysters into a double boiler or into
the top of the chafing dish. As soon as the edges curl add the slightly
beaten yolks of three eggs, a few grains of pepper and half a teaspoon
of salt. Set over hot water and as soon as the egg thickens add a
teaspoon of lemon juice. Spread on slices of toasted brown bread and
garnish with celery tips. Celery salt is a good addition to the
seasoning.</p>


<p><b>RECHAUFFE OF FINNAN HADDIE</b>&mdash;Cover a finnan haddie with boiling water
and let it simmer for twenty minutes, then remove the kettle and flake,
discarding the skin and bones. For three cups of fish scald two cups of
thin cream and add to the fish. Season with paprika or a dash of
cayenne, and when thoroughly heated stir in the yolks of two eggs,
diluted with a little hot cream.</p>


<p><b>SCALLOPED CLAMS IN SHELL</b>&mdash;Chop the clams very fine and season with
salt and cayenne pepper. In another dish mix some powdered crackers,
moistened first with warm milk, then with clam liquor, a beaten egg and
some melted butter, the quantity varying with the amount of clams used;
stir in the chopped clams. Wash clean as many shells as the mixture will
fill, wipe and butter them, fill heaping full with the mixture,
smoothing with a spoon. Place in rows in a baking pan and bake until
well browned. Send to the table hot.</p>


<p><b>SCALLOPED SHRIMPS</b>&mdash;Make a sauce with a level tablespoon of cornstarch,
a rounding tablespoon of butter and one cup of milk cooked together five
minutes. Season with one-quarter level teaspoon of salt and a few grains
of cayenne. Add one can of shrimps after removing all bits of shell and
mincing them fine. Use, if preferred, the same amount of fresh shrimps.
Put into buttered scallop shells, scatter fine bread crumbs over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> the
top of each, and dot with bits of butter. Set in a quick oven to brown
the crumbs, and serve hot in the shells.</p>


<p><b>STEWED CODFISH</b>&mdash;Take a piece of boiled cod, remove the skin and bones
and pick into flakes. Put these in a stewpan, with a little butter,
salt, pepper, minced parsley and juice of a lemon. Put on the fire and
when the contents of the pan are quite hot the fish is ready to serve.</p>


<p><b>CODFISH CONES</b>&mdash;When it is not convenient to make and preparation into
shapes, dip them into egg beaten with cream, then in sifted breadcrumbs
and let them stand for half an hour or so to dry; then fry them a
delicate color after plunging into boiling lard. Take them out, drain,
place on a napkin on a dish and serve. The remainder of the chicken
stock may be used for making consomme or soup.</p>

<h2><a name="BEEF_VEAL_AND_PORK" id="BEEF_VEAL_AND_PORK"></a>BEEF, VEAL AND PORK</h2>


<p><b>BEEF EN CASSEROLE</b>&mdash;Have a steak cut two inches thick and broil two
minutes on each side. Lay in a casserole and pour round two cups of rich
brown sauce; add three onions cut in halves.</p>


<p><b>BEEF HASH CAKES</b>&mdash;Chop cold corned beef fine and add a little more than
the same measure of cold boiled potatoes, chopped less fine than the
beef. Season with onion juice, make into small cakes, and brown in
butter or beef drippings; serve each cake on a slice of buttered toast
moistened slightly.</p>


<p><b>BEEF RAGOUT</b>&mdash;Another way to serve the remnants of cold meat is to melt
one rounding tablespoon of butter in a pan and let it brown lightly. Add
two rounding tablespoons of flour and stir until smooth and browned; add
one cup of strained tomato and one cup of stock or strained gravy, or
part gravy and part water. When this sauce is thickened add two cups of
meat cut in small, thin slices or shavings. Stir until heated through
and no longer, as that will harden the meat. Season with salt and
pepper, and serve at once.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>


<p><b>BOILED BONED HAM</b>&mdash;Wash a ham, place it in a saucepan, cover with cold
water and boil for four or five hours, according to its size. Take out
the bone, roll the ham and place it in a basin with a large weight on
top. When cold put it on a dish, garnish with parsley, and serve.</p>


<p><b>BONED HAM</b>&mdash;Have the bone taken from a small ham and put into a kettle
of cold water with one onion cut in quarters, a dozen cloves, and a bay
leaf. Cook slowly until tender and do not test it until you have allowed
fifteen minutes to the pound. Take from the kettle, remove the skin,
brush with beaten egg, sprinkle with bread crumbs and set in the oven to
brown.</p>


<p><b>BREADED CUTLETS</b>&mdash;Have the cutlets cut into portions of the right size
for serving. Dust each side with salt and pepper. Beat one egg with a
tablespoon of cold water, dip the cutlets in this and roll in fine bread
crumbs. Fry three slices of salt pork in the frying-pan and cook the
cutlets in this fat. As veal must be well done to be wholesome, cook it
slowly about fifteen minutes. Serve with a gravy made from the contents
of the pan or with a tomato sauce.</p>


<p><b>BROILED LIVER AND BACON</b>&mdash;As broiling in most cases is wasteful, the
liver and bacon are generally fried together, but the dish is somewhat
spoiled by this method. The best way is to fry the well-trimmed slices
of bacon, and after having washed and sliced the liver, say a third of
an inch thick, dry it on a cloth and dip in flour. Place in the bacon
fat and broil over a clear fire, adding pepper and salt while cooking.
When done lay on a dish, placing a piece of bacon on each piece of
liver.</p>


<p><b>BROILED PIG'S FEET</b>&mdash;Thoroughly clean as many pig's feet as are
required, and split lengthwise in halves, tying them with a broad tape
so they will not open in cooking. Put in a saucepan with a seasoning of
parsley, thyme, bay leaf, allspice, carrots and onions, with sufficient
water to cover. Boil slowly until tender, and let them cool in the
liquor. Dip in the beaten yolks of eggs and warmed butter. Sprinkle with
salt and pepper and cover with bread crumbs seasoned with very finely
chopped shallot and parsley. Put on a gridiron over a clear fire and
broil until well and evenly browned. Unbind and arrange on a dish,
garnish with fried parsley and serve.</p>


<p><b>BROILED SHEEP'S KIDNEYS</b>&mdash;To broil sheep's kidneys cut them open, put
them on small skewers. Season with salt and pepper and broil. When done
serve with shallot or maitre d'hotel sauce.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>


<p><b>BRUNSWICK STEW</b>&mdash;Cut up one chicken, preferably a good fat hen, cover
with cold water, season with salt and pepper, and cook slowly until
about half done. Add six ears of green corn, splitting through the
kernels, one pint butter beans and six large tomatoes chopped fine. A
little onion may be added if desired. Cook until the vegetables are
thoroughly done, but very slowly, so as to avoid burning. Add strips of
pastry for dumplings and cook five minutes. Fresh pork can be used in
place of the chicken and canned vegetables instead of the fresh.</p>


<p><b>CALVES' TONGUES</b>&mdash;Wash and put into a saucepan with half a dozen slices
of carrot, an onion sliced, five cloves, a teaspoon of whole
peppercorns, and half a level tablespoon of salt. Cover with boiling
water and simmer until tender. Drain and cool a little, then take off
the skin. Drop back into the hot liquid to reheat. Serve with a sauce.
Melt one-quarter cup of butter, add three slightly rounding tablespoons
of flour, stir and cook until browned, add two cups of broth, brown
stock of rich gravy melted in hot water, one-half level teaspoon of
salt, the same of paprika, a saltspoon of allspice, one tablespoon of
vinegar, a few grains of cayenne, and half a tablespoon of capers. Pour
over the tongues and serve.</p>


<p><b>CORNED BEEF HASH</b>&mdash;To two cups of chopped cold corned beef, add two
cups of chopped cold boiled potatoes. Heat three tablespoons of bacon
fat in a frying pan and add the meat and potato, add pepper and salt, if
necessary, and moisten with water. Cook slowly until a nice brown
underneath. Roll from the pan on to a hot platter. Garnish with parsley
and serve with pickled beets.</p>


<p><b>ENGLISH POT ROAST</b>&mdash;Cut one pound of cold roast into two-inch pieces,
slice four good sized potatoes thin, also one onion, into a deep dish,
put a layer of the beef, one of potatoes, one of onions, salt and
pepper, another layer of meat, potatoes and onions, season again, add
one cup gravy, and over all put a thick layer of potatoes. Bake three
hours&mdash;the longer and slower the better.</p>


<p><b>FRANKFORT SAUSAGE</b>&mdash;For this use any part of the pig, but equal
quantities of lean and fat. Mince fine, season with ground coriander
seed, salt, pepper, and a small quantity of nutmeg. Have ready skins,
well cleaned and soaked in cold water for several hours, fill with the
seasoned meat, secure the ends and hang in a cool, dry place until
needed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>


<p><b>FRIED HAM</b>&mdash;Cut off a thick slice of ham. Place in a saucepan over the
fire, with sufficient water to cover and let come to a boil. Pour off
the water, and fry the ham slowly until it is brown on both sides.
Season with pepper and serve. Eggs are usually served with fried ham.
They may be fried in the same pan or separately, in sufficient grease to
prevent burning. Season with salt and pepper, place around the ham.</p>


<p><b>HAM AND CHICKEN PIE</b>&mdash;Trim off the skin of some cold chicken and cut
the meat into small pieces. Mix with an equal quantity of finely chopped
lean ham and a small lot of chopped shallot. Season with salt, pepper
and pounded mace, moisten with a few tablespoonfuls of white stock.
Butter a pie dish, line the edges with puff paste and put in the
mixture, placing puff paste over the top. Trim it around the edges,
moisten and press together, cut a small hole in the top, and bake in a
moderate oven. When cooked, pour a small quantity of hot cream through
the hole in the top of the pie, and serve.</p>


<p><b>HAM CROQUETTES</b>&mdash;Chop very fine one-fourth of a pound of ham; mix with
it an equal quantity of boiled and mashed potatoes, two hard boiled eggs
chopped, one tablespoonful chopped parsley. Season to taste. Then stir
in the yolk of an egg. Flour the hands and shape the mixture into small
balls. Fry in deep fat. Place on a dish, garnish with parsley and serve.</p>


<p><b>HASH WITH DROPPED EGGS</b>&mdash;Mince or grind cold cooked meat and add
two-thirds as much cold chopped vegetables. The best proportions of
vegetables are half potato and one-quarter each of beets and carrots.
Put a little gravy stock or hot water with butter melted in it, into a
saucepan, turn in the meat and vegetables and heat, stirring all the
time. Season with salt, pepper, and a little onion juice if liked. Turn
into a buttered baking dish, smooth over, and set in the oven to brown.
Take up and press little depressions in the top, and drop an egg into
each. Set back into the oven until the egg is set, but not cooked hard.
Serve in the same dish.</p>


<p><b>LAMB CHOPS EN CASSEROLE</b>&mdash;Trim off the superfluous fat from the chops,
and place them in a casserole with a medium sized onion, sliced and
separated into rings. Cover each layer of chops with the onion rings,
then add a pint of boiling water. Cover and cook for one hour and
one-half in a moderate oven. Add salt and pepper and some sliced carrot,
and cook until the carrot is tender. Remove the chops to a hot platter
and pour over them the gravy which may be thickened, then garnish with
the carrot.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>


<p><b>LAMB CURRY</b>&mdash;Cut the meat into small pieces, (and the inferior
portions, such as the neck can be utilized in a curry), roll in flour
and fry in hot olive oil, pork fat, or butter, until a rich brown. Mince
or slice an onion and fry in the same way. Then put into a saucepan,
cover with boiling water, and simmer until the bones and gristly pieces
will slip out. When the meat is sufficiently tender add a cupful each
strained tomato and rice, then a powder. Cook ten minutes longer and
serve.</p>


<p><b>MEAT PIE</b>&mdash;Chop fine, enough of cold roast beef to make two cupfuls,
also one small onion, pare as many potatoes as desired and boil, mash
and cream as for mashed potatoes. Drain a cupful of tomato liquid free
from seeds, stir meat, onion and tomato juice together, put in a deep
dish, spread potatoes over the top and bake in a hot oven.</p>


<p><b>MINCED MUTTON</b>&mdash;Mince the meat from a cold roast of mutton, put into a
saucepan. Make a roux, moisten with a little stock and season with salt
and pepper, adding butter and some gherkins. Put the minced meat into
the sauce and let it cook without boiling. Serve with thin slices of
bread around the plate.</p>


<p><b>PIG'S EARS, LYONNAISE</b>&mdash;Singe off all the hair from pig's ears, scrape
and wash well and cut lengthwise into strips. Place them in a saucepan
with a little stock, add a small quantity of flour, a few slices of
onion fried, salt and pepper to taste. Place the pan over a slow fire
and simmer until the ears are thoroughly cooked. Arrange on a dish, add
a little lemon juice to the liquor and pour over the ears. Serve with a
garnish of fried bread.</p>


<p><b>PORK CUTLETS AND ANCHOVY SAUCE</b>&mdash;Broil on a well greased gridiron, over
the fire, nicely cut and trimmed cutlets of pork. Place frills on the
bones of the cutlets. Serve very hot with Anchovy Sauce.</p>


<p><b>RAGOUT OF COOKED MEAT</b>&mdash;Cut one pint of cold meat into half-inch dice,
removing the fat, bone and gristle. Put the meat into a stew pan, cover
with boiling water and simmer slowly two or three hours or until very
tender. Then add half a can of mushrooms cut fine, two tablespoons of
lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste. Wet one tablespoonful of
cornstarch to a smooth paste with a little cold water and stir into the
boiling liquor, add a teaspoon of caramel if not brown enough. Cook ten
minutes and serve plain or in a border of mashed potatoes. The seasoning
may be varied by using one teaspoon of curry powder, a few grains of
cayenne or half a tumbler of currant jelly and salt to taste.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>


<p><b>RICE AND BEEF CROQUETTES</b>&mdash;To use up cold meat economically combine two
cups of chopped beef or mutton with two cups of freshly boiled rice.
Season well with salt, pepper, onion juice, a large teaspoon of minced
parsley, and a teaspoon of lemon juice. Pack on a large plate and set
away to cool. After the mixture is cold, shape into croquettes, dip into
beaten egg, roll in fine crumbs and fry in smoking hot fat.</p>


<p><b>ROLLED RIB ROAST</b>&mdash;Have the backbone and ribs removed and utilize them
for making a stew for lunch. Tie the meat into a round shape and
sprinkle it with salt and pepper, then dredge with flour and place in a
dripping pan. Have the oven hot when the meat is first put into it, in
order that it may be seared over quickly to prevent the juices from
escaping. Then reduce the heat and baste with the fat in the pan. When
done place on a hot platter and surround with riced potato.</p>


<p><b>SHEEP'S BRAINS, WITH SMALL ONIONS</b>&mdash;Take sheep's brains. Soak in
lukewarm water and blanch. Stew with thin slices of bacon, a little
white wine, parsley, shallots, cloves, small onions, salt and pepper.
When done arrange the brains on a dish, with the onion's around; reduce
the sauce and serve. Calves' brains may be dressed in the same way.</p>


<p><b>SHEEP'S TONGUES</b>&mdash;Sheep's tongues are usually boiled in water and then
broiled. To dress them, first skin and split down the center. Dip them
in butter or sweet oil, mixed with parsley, green onions, mushrooms,
clove of garlic, all shredded fine, salt and pepper. Then cover with
bread crumbs and broil. Serve with an acid sauce.</p>


<p><b>SHOULDER OF VEAL BRAISED</b>&mdash;Buy a shoulder of veal and ask the butcher
to bone it and send the bones with the meat. Cover the bones with cold
water and when it comes to a boil skim, then add a little onion and
carrot and a few seasoning herbs and any spices desired. Simmer gently
for an hour or so until you have a pint of stock. To make the stuffing
take a stale loaf, cut off the crust and soak in a little cold water
until soft. Rub the crumbs of the loaf as fine as possible in the hands,
then add to the soaked and softened crust. Chop a half cup of suet fine,
put into a frying pan a tablespoon of the suet, and when hot add an
onion chopped fine. Cook until brown then add to the bread with regular
poultry seasoning or else salt, pepper, and a bit of thyme. Mix well and
stuff the cavity in the shoulder, then pull the flaps of the meat over
and sew up. Put the rest of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> suet in the frying pan and having
dusted the meat with flour, salt and pepper and a sprinkling of sugar,
brown on all sides in the fat into the bottom of the braising pan, which
may be any shallow iron pot or granite kettle with a tight cover, put a
layer of thin sliced onions and carrots, a bit of bay leaf and sprigs of
parsley, and on this lay the meat. Add two or three cloves, pour hot
stock around it, cover closely and braise in a hot oven for three hours.</p>


<p><b>SPANISH CHOPS</b>&mdash;Gash six French chops on outer edge, extending cut more
than half way through lean meat. Stuff, dip in crumbs, egg and crumbs,
fry in deep fat five minutes and drain on brown paper.</p>

<p>For the stuffing mix six tablespoons of soft bread crumbs, three
tablespoons of chopped cooked ham, two tablespoons chopped mushroom
caps, two tablespoons melted butter, salt and pepper to taste.</p>


<p><b>HARICOT OF MUTTON</b>&mdash;To make a la bourgeoise, cut a shoulder of mutton
in pieces about the width of two fingers. Mix a little butter with a
tablespoonful of flour and place over a slow fire, stirring until the
color of cinnamon. Put in the pieces of meat, giving them two or three
turns over the fire, then add some stock, if you have it, or about half
pint of hot water, which must be stirred in a little at a time. Season
with salt, pepper, parsley, green onions, bay leaf, thyme, garlic,
cloves, and basil. Set the whole over a slow fire and when half done
skim off as much fat as possible. Have ready some turnips, cut in
pieces, and stew with the meat. When done take out the herbs and skim
off what fat remains, reducing the stock if too thin.</p>


<p><b>VEAL CROQUETTES</b>&mdash;Make a thick sauce from one cup of milk, two level
tablespoons of butter, and four level tablespoons of flour. Cook five
minutes, season with salt, pepper and celery salt, and a few drops of
lemon juice, and a tablespoon of finely minced parsley. Add two cups of
cold cooked veal chopped fine and cool the mixture. Shape into little
rolls, dip in an egg beaten with one tablespoon of water then roll in
fine bread crumbs. Fry in deep smoking hot fat. Be sure to coat the
whole surface with egg and to have the fat very hot, as the mixture has
been cooked once and merely needs beating to the center and browning on
the outside.</p>


<p><b>VEAL LOAF</b>&mdash;Mince fine three pounds lean raw veal and a quarter of a
pound of fat pork. Add a half onion chopped fine or grated, a
tablespoonful of salt, a teaspoonful pepper and a tea<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>spoonful seasoning
herbs. Mix well, add two-thirds of a cup cracker crumbs, a half cup veal
gravy, the yolk of one egg and the whites of two beaten together. Form
into a loaf, pressing firmly together. Brush over with the yolk of an
egg, dust with finely rolled cracker crumbs and set in a greased rack in
the dripping pan. When it begins to brown, turn a cup of hot water into
the pan and baste frequently until done. It will take about an hour and
a half in a moderate oven.</p>


<p><b>VEAL PATTIES</b>&mdash;Make a sauce of two level tablespoons each of butter and
flour, one cup of stock or boiling water, and one cup of thin cream.
Cook five minutes, add two cups of finely chopped cooked veal, half a
level teaspoon of salt, a saltspoon of pepper, also the beaten yolks of
two eggs, and a tablespoon of finely minced parsley. As soon as the egg
thickens take from the fire and fill hot pastry cases.</p>


<p><b>VIRGINIA STEW</b>&mdash;A half grown chicken or two squirrels, one slice of
salt pork, twelve large tomatoes, three cups of lima beans, one large
onion, two large Irish potatoes, twelve ears of corn, one-fourth pound
of butter, one-fourth pound of lard, one gallon of boiling water, two
tablespoonfuls salt and pepper; mix as any ordinary soup and let it cook
for a couple of hours or more, then serve.</p>


<p><b>BROILING STEAK</b>&mdash;While many prefer steak fairly well done, still the
great majority desire to have it either rare, or certainly not overdone.
For those who wish a steak well done&mdash;completely through&mdash;and still not
to have the outside crisp to a cinder, it is necessary to cut the steak
possibly as thin as one-half inch, and then the outside can have that
delicious and intense scorching which quickly prevents the escape of
juices, and also gives the slightly burned taste which at its perfect
condition is the most delicious flavor from my own preference that can
be given to a steak. By this I do not mean a steak burned to a cinder,
but slightly scorched over a very hot fire.</p>


<p><b>FOR RARE BROILED STEAK</b>&mdash;For those who are fond of rare steak it can be
cut from one inch to one and one-quarter inches in thickness and the
outside thoroughly and quickly broiled, leaving the inside practically
only partially cooked, so that the blood will follow the knife and still
the steak has been heated completely through and a thin crust on either
side has been well cooked, which has formed the shell to retain the
juices.</p>


<p><b>PROPERLY FRYING STEAK</b>&mdash;To fry steak properly (although some claim it
is not proper to fry steak under any cir<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>cumstances), it is necessary to
have the butter, oleo, fat or grease piping hot, for two reasons: First,
the steak sears over quickly, and the juices are thus retained within
the steak to better advantage than by the slow process of cooking, but
even more important is the fact that the incrustation thus formed not
only holds the juices within the steak, but prevents the fat from
penetrating and making the steak greasy, soggy and unattractive. As a
rule, however, we must acknowledge that broiled steak is in varying
degrees largely superior to fried steak.</p>


<p><b>BROILED LOIN STEAKS</b>&mdash;Two loin steaks of about a pound each: season
with salt and pepper to taste, baste on either side with a little oil.
Place on a broiler over a bright charcoal fire, and broil for six

frequently. When done sift over the top browned cracker crumbs and
garnish with parsley.</p>


<p><b>ROAST BEEF ON SPIT</b>&mdash;Remove most of the flap from sirloin and trim
neatly. Have a clear brisk fire and place the meat close to it for the
first half hour, then move it farther away, basting frequently, and when
done sprinkle well with salt. The gravy may be prepared by taking the
meat from the dripping pan which will have a brown sediment. Pour in

<p><b>STEAK</b>&mdash;Cut the steak half an inch thick from between the two ribs,
remove all gristle and fat, and trim in the shape of a flat pear.
Sprinkle both sides with salt, pepper and oil to prevent outside
hardening. Broil ten minutes over a moderate and even fire. Place about
four ounces of maitre d'hotel butter on a dish. Lay the steak upon it
and garnish with fried potatoes, serving either piquant, D'Italian, or
tomato sauce.</p>


<p><b>STEWED SAUSAGE WITH CABBAGE</b>&mdash;Procure a medium sized white cabbage,
remove all the green leaves, and cut it into quarters, removing the
center stalks. Wash thoroughly in cold water, drain well and cut into
small pieces. Put in boiling salted water for five minutes. Take out and
put in cold water and cool moderately. Drain in a colander and put in a
saucepan with one gill of fat from soup stock or one ounce of butter.

minutes, then plunge it into boiling water. Hold it by the head and
shake around until the hairs begin to loosen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> Take out of the water and
rub vigorously with a coarse towel, until all hairs are removed. Cut the
pig open, remove the entrails, wash thoroughly in cold water. Dry on a
towel, cut the feet off at the first joint leaving enough skin to turn
over and keep it wrapped in a wet cloth until ready for use.</p>

<p>Instructions for Preparing Poultry Before Dressing.</p>

<p>To serve poultry tender and delicate; it should be kept some hours after
being killed before boiling or roasting. Poultry intended for dinner
should be killed the evening before. When poultry has ceased to bleed,
before picking put it into cold water, in a vessel large enough to
completely cover it. Then take out and soak in boiling water for a few
minutes. Pick it, being careful to take out all the small feathers. When
cleaning the inside of poultry or game be sure not to break the gall
bladder, for it will give a bitter taste to the meat. Be equally careful
not to tear the intestines near the gizzard, as it will make the inside
dirty and spoil the whole bird.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

the butter and on both sides. Take up the chicken, brush the inside over
with an egg beaten with one tablespoon of cold water, lay in a dripping
pan and dust over the egg half a cup of fine bread crumbs mixed with the
same amount of minced cooked ham. Set in a hot oven and finish cooking.

<p><b>CHICKEN CROQUETTES</b>&mdash;Stir a pint of fine chopped chicken into a cup and
a quarter of sauce made of one-third cup<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> of flour, three tablespoons of
butter, a cup of chicken stock and one-fourth cup of cream, season with
a few drops of onion juice, a teaspoon of lemon, one teaspoonful celery
salt and pepper. When thoroughly chilled form into cylindrical shapes,
roll in egg and bread crumbs and fry in deep fat. Serve surrounded with
peas and figures stamped upon cooked slices of carrot. Season with salt,
paprika and butter.</p>


<p><b>CHICKEN CROQUETTES</b>&mdash;Take two chickens weighing about two pounds each,
put them into a saucepan with water to cover, add two onions and
carrots, a small bunch of parsley and thyme, a few cloves and half a
grated nutmeg, and boil until birds are tender; then remove the skin,
gristle and sinews and chop the meat as fine as possible. Put into a
saucepan one pound of butter and two tablespoonfuls of flour, stir over
the fire for a few minutes and add half a pint of the liquor the
chickens were cooked in and one pint of rich cream, and boil for eight
or ten minutes, stirring continually. Remove the pan from the fire,

marjoram, add the chopped meat and stir well. Then stir in rapidly the
yolks of four eggs, place the saucepan on the fire for a minute,
stirring well, turn the mass onto a dish, spread it out and let it get
cold. Cover the hands with flour and form the preparation into shapes,
dip them into egg beaten with cream, then in sifted breadcrumbs and let
them stand for half an hour or so to dry; then fry them a delicate color
after plunging into boiling lard. Take them out, drain, place on a
napkin on a dish and serve. The remainder of the chicken stock may be
used for making consomme or soup.</p>


<p><b>CHICKEN CROQUETTES WITH FISH FLAVOR</b>&mdash;The foundation of all croquettes
is a thick white sauce which stiffens when cold, so that mixed with
minced fish, chicken or other compounds it can be easily handled and
shaped into pears, cylinders, ovals, etc. When cooked the croquettes
should be soft and creamy inside. This sauce is made as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Scald in a double boiler one pint rich milk or cream. Melt in a granite
saucepan two even tablespoons butter, then add two heaping
tablespoonfuls cornstarch or flour, and one tablespoon of flavor.</p>

<p>When blended add one-third of the hot cream and keep stirring as it
cooks and thickens. When perfectly smooth put in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> all the cream. The
sauce should be very thick. Add the seasoning, a half teaspoonful of
salt, a half teaspoonful celery salt, white peppers or paprika to taste,
then the meat.</p>

<p>In shaping the croquettes take about a tablespoonful of the mixture and
handling gently and carefully, press gently into whatever shape is
desired. Have ready a board sprinkled lightly with bread or cracker
crumbs, and roll the croquettes lightly in this, taking care not to
exert pressure sufficient to break them. Coat the croquettes with some
slightly salted beaten egg. Then roll again in the crumbs. Fry in deep
hot fat, a few at a time, then drain on paper.</p>


<p><b>CHICKEN POT PIE</b>&mdash;Cut a fowl into pieces to serve and cook in water to
cover until the bones will come out easily. Before taking them out drop
dumplings in, cover closely and cook ten minutes without lifting the

kept boiling until the end. For the dumplings sift two cups of flour
twice with half a level teaspoon of salt and four level teaspoons of
baking powder. Mix with about seven-eighths cup of milk, turn out on a
well floured board and pat out half an inch thick. Cut into small cakes.
If this soft dough is put into the kettle in spoonfuls the time of
cooking must be doubled. The bones and meat will keep the dough from
settling into the liquid and becoming soggy. Arrange the meat in the
center with dumplings around the edge and a sprig of parsley between
each. Thicken the liquid and season with salt and pepper as needed and a
rounding tablespoon of butter.</p>


<p><b>CHICKEN TIMBALES</b>&mdash;Mix three-fourths of a cupful of flour with a half
teaspoonful of salt. Add gradually while stirring constantly, one-half
cupful of milk and one well beaten egg and one tablespoonful of olive
oil. Shape, using a hot Swedish timbale iron, and cook in deep fat until
delicately brown. Take from the iron and invert on brown paper to drain.
To make the filling for a dozen timbales, remove bones and skin from a
pint bowlful of the white or white and dark meat mixed of cold boiled or
roasted chicken, and cut in half inch pieces. Put over the first in a
saucepan two tablespoonfuls of butter and two of flour and when melted
and blended add milk and chicken broth, a cupful and a half or more as
desired to make a rich cream sauce. Season with salt and pepper, add the
chicken and, if preferred, one-half cupful of mushrooms cut in pieces
the same size as the chicken. Then brown in butter before adding to the
sauce. Fill the timbales.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p><b>DEVILED CHICKEN</b>&mdash;Split the chickens down the back and broil until
done, lay on a hot dripping pan and spread on a sauce, scatter fine
crumbs over and set in a quick oven to brown. For the sauce beat a
rounding tablespoon of butter light with one-half teaspoon of mixed
mustard, one teaspoon of vinegar and a pinch of cayenne.</p>

chicken that has been boiled and cut from the bone in strips. Mix a
quart of rich chicken stock that has been boiled down and cleared with a
teaspoonful each of lemon juice, chopped parsley, a dash of celery salt
and a quarter teaspoonful each of salt and paprika. At the last stir in
a teaspoonful of granulated gelatin that has been dissolved. When the
jelly begins to thicken add the chicken and turn it into a mold. To have
the chicken scattered evenly through the jelly, stand the dish
containing the jelly in a pan of ice and turn in the jelly layer by
layer, covering each with chicken as soon as it begins to thicken.</p>


<p><b>MARBLED CHICKEN</b>&mdash;Steam a young fowl until tender or cook it gently in
a small amount of water. Cut all the meat from the bones, keeping the
white and dark meat separate. Chop the meat with a sharp knife, but do

eggs and one medium-size onion. Mix all of these together with three
breakfast cupfuls of stale breadcrumbs, three well beaten eggs and
one-half cupful of poultry fat that has been warmed; season to taste

slices, put them all into a saucepan with one-quarter pound of minced
fat bacon and any obtainable fat from the turkey. Also a good size lump
of butter, with salt and pepper to taste. Cook for ten minutes and let
it get cold before using. A turkey should be stuffed with this three
days before it is cooked, and truffle sauce should accompany it.</p>


<p><b>ENGLISH STUFFING</b>&mdash;First, take some stale bread (use your own judgment
as to the quantity), and brown it in your oven. Also one onion (red ones
preferred), a quarter of a pound of fresh pork, or sausages, and run it
through your meat grinder with a few stalks of celery; place it in a
saucepan, in which a small lump of butter has been dissolved. Beat one
or two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> eggs in a pint of sweet milk. Stir all ingredients well. Place
on the fire or in the oven and continue to stir, so as to see that the
onions are cooked. After you have this done set in a cool place; when
the above articles are cold, place inside the turkey. Your seasoning
that you place in the turkey, or make your gravy with, is sufficient.
Roast it in the same way as you have done in the past.</p>

loaf, using a sharp knife. Then instead of cutting crosswise cut in thin
lengthwise pieces. Treat the brown loaf in the same way. Butter a slice
of the white bread on one side and do the same with a brown slice. Put
the two buttered sides together with a thin layer of fresh cream cheese
between. Next butter the top of the brown slice of bread, spread again

<p><b>ROASTED CANVAS-BACK DUCK</b>&mdash;Procure a fine canvas-back duck, pick,
singe, draw thoroughly and wipe; throw inside a light pinch of salt, run
in the head from the end of the head to the back, press and place in a
roasting pan. Sprinkle with salt, put in a brisk oven, and cook for
eighteen minutes. Arrange on a very hot dish, untruss, throw in two
tablespoons of white broth. Garnish with slices of fried hominy and
currant jelly. Redhead and mallard ducks are prepared the same way.</p>


<p><b>BROILED WILD DUCK</b>&mdash;Pick, singe and draw well a pair of wild ducks,
split them down the back without detaching, place them skin downwards on
a dish, season with salt and pepper and pour over two tablespoons of
oil. Boil the birds well in this marinade, place them on a broiler on a
brisk fire, broil for seven minutes on each side. Place them on a hot
dish and cover with maitre d'hotel butter, garnish with watercress, and
serve.</p>


<p><b>ROAST DUCK WITH ORANGE SAUCE</b>&mdash;Scrape a tablespoonful each of fat,
bacon, and raw onion and fry them together for five minutes. Add the

add it to the gravy that has come from the wild fowl while roasting. If
there is a large quantity of gravy less wine and catsup will be
necessary.</p>


<p><b>SALMI OF GAME</b>&mdash;Cut cold roast partridges, grouse or quail into joints
and lay aside while preparing the gravy. This is made of the bones,
dressing, skin, and general odds and ends after the neatest pieces of
the birds have been selected. Put this (the scraps) into a saucepan,
with one small onion minced, and a bunch of sweet herbs, pour in a pint
of water and whatever gravy may be left, and stew, closely covered, for
nearly an hour. A few bits of pork should be added if there is no gravy.
Skim and strain, return to the fire, and add the juice of a half lemon,
with a pinch of nutmeg, thicken with browned flour if the stuffing has
not thickened it sufficiently, boil up and pour over the reserved meat,
which should be put into another saucepan. Warm until smoking hot, but
do not let it boil. Arrange the pieces of bird in heap upon a dish and
pour the gravy over them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p><b>BEAUREGARD EGGS</b>&mdash;Two level tablespoons butter, two level tablespoons
flour, one-half level teaspoon salt, one cup milk, four hard-boiled
eggs. Make a white sauce of the butter, flour, salt and milk, and add
the whites of the eggs chopped fine. Cut buttered toast in pointed
pieces and arrange on a hot plate to form daisy petals. Cover with the
sauce and put the egg yolks through a ricer into the center.</p>


<p><b>EGG AND POTATO SCALLOP</b>&mdash;Fill a buttered baking dish with alternate
layers of cold boiled potatoes sliced thin, hard-boiled eggs also
sliced, and a rich white sauce poured over each layer. Cover the top
with buttered crumbs and set in the oven until the crumbs are browned.</p>


<p><b>EGGS SCRAMBLED IN MILK</b>&mdash;Half pint of milk, five eggs. Heat the milk in
a saucepan and when it is just at the boiling point stir in the eggs,
which should have been beaten enough to mix them thoroughly. Stir
steadily until they thicken, add a half teaspoonful of salt and serve at
once.</p>


<p><b>EGG WITH WHITE SAUCE FOR LUNCHEON</b>&mdash;Cut stale bread into one-fourth
slices and shape into rounds, then saute in olive oil. Arrange on a hot
platter and on each place a French poached egg. Cover with Marnay sauce,
sprinkle with buttered breadcrumbs and put in oven just long enough to
brown crumbs. For the Marnay sauce, cook one and one-half cups of
chicken stock with one slice of onion, one slice carrot, bit of bay
leaf, a sprig of parsley and six peppercorns until reduced to one cup,
then strain. Melt one-fourth cup of butter, add one-fourth cup flour,

<p><b>LIGHT OMELET</b>&mdash;Separate your eggs and beat the yolks until thick and
light colored, adding a tablespoonful cold water for each yolk and a
seasoning of salt and pepper. Beat the whites until they are dry and
will not slip from the dish, then turn into them the beaten yolks,
folding carefully until thoroughly blended. Have the pan hot and butter
melted, turn in the mixture, smothering it over the top, cover and place
on asbestos mat on top of stove until well risen, then uncover and set
in the oven to dry. Try it with a heated silver knife thrust in the
middle. When done, cut across the middle, fold and turn out, dust with
sugar, glaze and serve quickly.</p>


<p><b>OMELET FOR ONE</b>&mdash;Beat the yolks of two eggs until creamy, add four
tablespoons of milk and saltspoon of salt. Add the whites beaten stiff
and put into a hot pan in which a rounding teaspoon of butter is melted.
The mixture should begin to bubble almost at once; cook three or four
minutes, slipping a knife under now and then to keep the under side from
burning. When the top begins to set, fold it over and turn on a hot
platter.</p>


<p><b>SCRAMBLED EGGS WITH MUSHROOMS</b>&mdash;Pare, wash and slice half a pound of
fresh mushrooms, put them in a sautoir; cover, shake the sautoir once in
awhile and cook ten minutes. Break and beat five or six eggs in a
saucepan, adding seasoning of salt, pepper, nutmeg and one-half ounces
of butter cut into bits. Add the mushrooms, set over the fire, stir

into a heated dish, garnish with toasted bread points, and serve at
once.</p>


<p><b>SCRAMBLED EGGS WITH PEPPERS</b>&mdash;Scrambled eggs on toast with chopped
sweet green peppers make an excellent breakfast dish. Toast four slices
of bread, butter, and put where the platter on which they are arranged
will keep hot. Put a tablespoonful of butter in a hot frying-pan, as
soon as it bubbles turn in half a dozen eggs which have been broken into
a bowl, and mix with half a dozen tablespoonfuls of water. As the whites
begin to set, whip together quickly with a silver knife. Sprinkle over
the top two finely cut peppers from which the seeds have been removed,
stir through the eggs, let the whole cook a half minute, then pour over
the slices of toast, garnish with sprigs of parsley, and serve at once.</p>

with one cup lean boiled ham minced very fine and seasoned with cayenne
pepper, one-half teaspoon mixed mustard and one raw egg beaten. Roll
slightly in fine breadcrumbs and fry in hot deep fat a delicate brown.</p>


<p><b>BANANAS WITH OATMEAL</b>&mdash;Add a teaspoonful of salt to a quart of rapidly
boiling water and sprinkle in two cups of rolled oatmeal. Set the
saucepan into another dish of boiling water (double boiler), cover and
cook at least one hour. Longer cooking is preferable. Have ready half a
banana for each person to be served. The banana should be peeled and cut
in thin slices. Put a spoonful of the hot oatmeal over the bananas in
the serving dishes. Pass at the same time sugar and milk or cream. Other
cereals may be served with bananas in the same way.</p>


<p><b>SPAWN AND MILK</b>&mdash;Have the water boiling fast. Salt to taste, then
holding a handful of meal high in the left hand, let it sift slowly
between the fingers into the bubbling water, stirring all the time with
the right hand. Stir until a thin, smooth consistency obtains, then push
back on the fire where it will cook slowly for several hours, stirring
occasionally with a "pudding stick" or wooden spoon. It will thicken as
it cooks. Serve in bowls with plenty of good rich milk.</p>


<p><b>BOILED SAMP</b>&mdash;Soak two cupfuls over night in cold water. In the morning
wash thoroughly, cover with boiling water, and simmer gently all day. Do
not stir, as that tends to make it mushy, but shake the pot frequently.
As the water boils away add more, but not enough to make much liquid.
About a half hour before serving add a cupful rich milk, tablespoon
butter, and salt to season. Let this boil up once, and serve hot.</p>


<p><b>MOLDED CEREAL WITH BANANA SURPRISE</b>&mdash;Turn any left-over breakfast
cereal, while still hot, into cups rinsed in cold water, half filling
the cups. When cold, scoop out the centers and fill the open spaces with
sliced bananas, turn from the cups onto a buttered agate pan, fruit
downward, and set into a hot oven to become very hot. Remove with a
broad-bladed knife to cereal dishes. Serve at once with sugar and cream
or milk.</p>

<p><b>SHRIMP BUTTER</b>&mdash;Pick and shell one pound of shrimps, place them in a
mortar and pound, add one-half pound of butter when well mixed; pass the
whole through a fine sieve. The butter is then ready for use.</p>


<p><b>SARDINE BUTTER</b>&mdash;Remove the skins and bones from seven or eight
sardines; put them in a mortar and pound until smooth. Boil two large
handfuls of parsley until tender, squeeze it as dry as possible, remove
all stalks and stems and chop it. Put the parsley in the mortar with the
fish and four ounces of butter, then pound again. When well incorporated
mold the butter into shapes. Keep on ice until ready for serving.
Excellent for hot toast.</p>


<p><b>MAITRE D'HOTEL BUTTER</b>&mdash;Quarter of a pound of butter, two
tablespoonfuls of chopped parsley, salt and pepper and juice of two
lemons. Mix thoroughly and keep in cool place.</p>


<p><b>CAULIFLOWER IN MAYONNAISE</b>&mdash;Select some large, cold boiled cauliflowers

to properly season. Heap them on a dish to form a point. Surround with a
garnish of cooked carrots, turnips and green vegetables, pour some white
mayonnaise sauce over all, and serve.</p>


<p><b>SARDINE COCKTAIL</b>&mdash;Drain and skin one-half box boneless sardines and
separate into small pieces. Add one-half cup tomato catsup, mixed with
two teaspoons Worcestershire sauce, one-half teaspoon tabasco sauce, the
juice of one lemon, and salt to taste. Chill thoroughly and serve in
scallop shells, placing each shell on a plate of crushed ice.</p>


<p><b>SAUCE FOR VARIOUS SHELLFISH IN THE SHAPE OF COCKTAIL</b>&mdash;For the truffle
sauce melt three tablespoons of butter, add three tablespoons of flour,
and stir until well blended, then pour on gradually while heating
constantly one cup milk and one-half cup heavy cream. Bring to the
boiling point and add two chopped truffles, two tablespoons Madeira
wine, salt and pepper to taste.</p>


<p><b>BAKED MILK</b>&mdash;Put fresh milk into a stone jar, cover with white paper
and bake in a moderate oven until the milk is thick as cream. This may
be taken by the most delicate stomach.</p>


<p><b>MINT VINEGAR</b>&mdash;Fill in a wide-mouthed bottle or a quart fruit jar with
fresh mint leaves, well washed and bruised a little. Let the leaves fall
in without pressing. Fill the jar with cider<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> vinegar, put on the
rubber, and turn the cover tightly. Let stand three weeks, uncover, and
drain off the vinegar into bottles and keep well corked.</p>


<p><b>BLACKBERRY VINEGAR</b>&mdash;Mash the berries to a pulp in an earthenware or
wooden vessel. Add good cider vinegar to cover and stand in sun during
the day and in the cellar at night, stirring occasionally. Next morning
strain and add the same amount fresh berries. Crush and pour the whole,
the strained juice, and set in the sun again all day and in the cellar
at night. The third day strain to each quart of the juice one pint water
and five pounds sugar. Heat slowly and when at boiling point skim, and
after it boils strain and bottle.</p>


<p><b>HOMEMADE VINEGAR</b>&mdash;For pineapple vinegar, cover the parings and some of
the fruit, if you wish, with water. A stone crock or glass jar is the
best receptacle for this purpose. Add sugar or sirup, according to the
condition of the fruit, and set in the sun where it can ferment
thoroughly. Skim frequently to remove all impurities, and when as acid
as desired, strain and bottle. Gooseberry vinegar is made by crushing
gooseberries not quite ripe, covering with cold water (three quarts of
water to two of fruit) and allowing it to stand for two days. Press and
strain. Allow a pint of sugar and half a yeast cake to each gallon of
the liquid. Set in the sun, and when the fluid has worked clear, strain
and leave in a warm place until as sharp as desired. A cloth should be
tied over the top of the jar to keep out insects and dust.</p>


<p><b>SAMP AND BEANS</b>&mdash;Soak a quart of the samp and a scant pint pea beans
over night in cold water, each in a separate vessel. In the morning put
the samp over to cook in a large pot, covering with fresh boiling water.
Simmer gently about two hours, protecting from scorch, by an asbestos
mat and a frequent shaking of the pot. As the samp commences to swell
and the water dries out add more. After two hours add the beans that
have been soaking, together with a pound of streaked salt pork. Season
with salt and pepper and continue the cooking all day, shaking
frequently. Just before serving add butter and more salt if it needs it.</p>

<p><b>NOODLE DOUGH FOR ITALIAN RAVIOLI</b>&mdash;Make noodle crust as you would for
noodles. Roll very fine and cover half the crust with ravioli dressing
half-inch thick. Turn over the other half to cover. Mark in squares as
shown in figure.</p>

<p>Cut with a pie cutter after marking. Drop one by one in salted boiling
water, cook about twenty minutes, drain and arrange on platter and
sprinkle each layer with grated cheese and mushroom sauce.</p>


<p><b>BOLOGNA SAUSAGE</b>&mdash;Chop fine one pound each of beef, pork, veal and fat
bacon. Mix with three-fourths of a pound of fine chopped beef suet and
season with sage, sweet herbs, salt and pepper. Press into large skins

places. Place in a deep saucepan, cover with boiling water, simmer
gently for an hour, lay on straw to dry and hang.</p>


<p><b>LEMON JELLY</b>&mdash;Grate two lemons and the juice of one. The yolks of three
eggs, two cups of sugar. Butter, the size of an egg. Boil until thick.</p>


<p><b>MARGARETTES</b>&mdash;One half-pound of peanuts, one pound of dates chopped
fine. One cup of milk in the dates and boil, add peanuts. Make a boiled
icing. Take the long branch crackers, spread the filling between the
crackers, put on the icing and put in the oven to brown.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p><b>BRUSSELS SPROUTS</b>&mdash;Wash well in salted water about two pounds of
Brussels sprouts and pick them over well. Place them on a fire in a
saucepan filled with water, a little salt and bicarbonate of soda. With
the lid off boil fast till tender; about twenty to twenty-five minutes.
When done drain them and dry on a cloth. Put in a large saucepan a
good-sized lump of butter and a little salt and pepper. Toss the sprouts
in this until they become quite hot again, but do not fry them. Serve on
a quartered round of buttered toast.</p>


<p><b>BRUSSELS SPROUTS MAITRE D'HOTEL</b>&mdash;Boil the sprouts and then place them
in a saucepan with a lump of butter and beat them well. Put half a pound
of fresh butter in a pan with two tablespoonfuls of chopped parsley, the
juice of a couple of lemons, a little salt and white pepper and mix
together well with a spatula, and when it boils stir quickly. Place the
sprouts on a dish and turn the sauce over them.</p>


<p><b>BRUSSELS SPROUTS SAUTED</b>&mdash;One pound of Brussels sprouts should be
thoroughly washed and boiled and then put into a pan over the fire
together with a good-sized lump of butter, a little salt, and toss for
eight minutes. Sprinkle over them a little chopped parsley, and serve
when done.</p>


<p><b>BAKED MUSHROOMS IN CUPS</b>&mdash;Peel and cut off the stalks of a dozen or
more large fat mushrooms, and chop up fine. Put the trimmings in a
stewpan with some water or clear gravy, and boil well. When nicely
flavored strain the liquor, return it to the stewpan with the mushrooms
and a moderate quantity of finely chopped parsley, season to taste with
salt and pepper, and boil gently on the side of the stove for nearly
three-quarters of an hour. Beat four eggs well in one-half teacupful of
cream, and strain. When the mushrooms are ready move the stewpan away
from the fire and stir in the beaten eggs. Butter some small cups or
molds, fill each with the mixture, and bake in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> brisk oven. Prepare
some white sauce; when baked turn the mushrooms out of the molds on a
hot dish, pour the sauce around them, and serve.</p>


<p><b>BOILED CHESTNUTS SERVED AS VEGETABLES</b>&mdash;Peel off the outside skin of
the chestnuts and steep them in boiling water until the skin can be
easily removed, and throw them into a bowl of cold water. Put two ounces
of butter into a saucepan with two tablespoons of flour and stir the
whole over a fire until well mixed. Then pour in one-half pint or more
of clear broth and continue stirring over the fire until it boils.
Season with salt, throw in the chestnuts and keep them simmering at the
side of the fire until tender. When served in this way they make a good
vegetable for roasted meat or poultry, particularly turkey.</p>


<p><b>BOILED CORN</b>&mdash;Choose short, thick ears of fresh corn, remove all the
husks except the inner layer: strip that down far enough to remove the
silk and any defective grains and then replace it, and tie at the upper
end of each ear of corn. Have ready a large pot half full of boiling
water, put in the corn and boil steadily for about twenty minutes, if
the ears are large, and fifteen minutes if they are small. Remove from
the boiling water, take off the strings, and serve hot at once. If
desirable, the inner husk may be removed before serving, but this must
be done very quickly, and the ears covered with a napkin or a clean
towel to prevent the heat from escaping. Serve plenty of salt, butter
and pepper with the corn. These may be mixed by heating them together,
and serve in a gravy bowl.</p>


<p><b>BOILED ONIONS WITH CREAM</b>&mdash;Peel twelve medium-sized onions, pare the
roots without cutting them, place in a saucepan, cover with salted
water, add a bunch of parsley, and boil for forty-five minutes; take
them from the saucepan, place them on a dish, covering with two gills of
cream sauce, mixed with two tablespoonfuls of broth, garnish, and serve.</p>

but do not beat, with a wooden spoon for five minutes, when it will be
sufficiently firm; butter a frying-pan, place it on a fire, and with a
ladle holding one gill put the mixture on the pan in twelve parts, being
careful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> that they do not touch one another, and fry till of a good
golden color, cooking for four or five minutes on each side. Dress them

minutes, then place on a dish which has been heated and pour over a gill
of maitre d'hotel sauce, and serve.</p>


<p><b>FRIED EGGPLANT</b>&mdash;Select a nice large eggplant, peel, remove the seeds,
and cut into pieces about one and one-half inches long and
three-quarters of an inch wide. Put them on a plate, sprinkle well with
salt and leave standing for an hour or so. Then wrap the pieces in a
cloth and twist it around so as to squeeze as much juice as possible
from them without breaking. Sprinkle over with flour, covering each side
well, and place them in a frying basket. Put a large lump of fat in a
stewpan and when it boils put in the basket. As each plant is nicely
browned take out of the basket, sprinkle with salt and lay on a sheet of
paper in front of a fire so as to drain as free as possible from fat.

Then arrange them on a double broiler, and broil over a moderate fire
for three minutes on each side. Serve in a folded napkin on a hot dish.</p>


<p><b>PARSNIP FRITTERS</b>&mdash;Peel and boil some parsnips until tender, then drain
thoroughly and mash, mixing in with them two beaten eggs, salt to taste,
and sufficient flour to bind them stiffly. Divide and mold the mixture
into small round cakes with floured hands. Put a large piece of butter
into a stewpan, place on the fire and let it boil. Then put in the cakes
and fry to a nice golden brown color. Take out and drain them, and serve
on a napkin spread over a hot dish, with a garnish of fried parsley.</p>


<p><b>MASHED PARSNIPS</b>&mdash;Wash and scrape some parsnips, cut in pieces
lengthwise, put them in a saucepan with boiling water, a little salt and
a small lump of drippings. Boil till tender, remove and place in a
colander to drain, and press all the waste out of them. Mash them till

have been fried to a nice brown, and serve.</p>


<p><b>STUFFED ONIONS, STEAMED</b>&mdash;Peel eight large onions and boil for ten
minutes, and salt them slightly. Remove them from the fire, drain quite
dry, push about half the insides out; chop the parts taken out very
small, together with a little sausage meat; add one teacupful of
breadcrumbs, one egg, and salt and pepper to taste. Put this mixture
into the cavity in the onions, piling a little on the top and bottom so
that none shall be left. Arrange them in a deep pan. Put them in a
steamer over a saucepan of water and steam for one hour and a half. Put
the pan in the oven to brown the tops of the onions, adding one
breakfast cupful of butter to prevent burning. Arrange them tastefully
on a dish, and serve hot.</p>


<p><b>POTATO CROQUETTES</b>&mdash;Take four boiled potatoes and add to them half
their weight in butter, the same quantity of powdered sugar, salt,
grated peel of half a lemon and two well beaten eggs. Mix thoroughly and
roll into cork-shaped pieces and dip into the beaten yolks of eggs,
rolling in sifted breadcrumbs. Let stand one hour and again dip in egg

of parsley.</p>


<p><b>CREAMED POTATOES</b>&mdash;Cut into cubes or dices about half a pound of boiled
potatoes and place in a shallow baking pan. Pour over them enough milk
or cream to cover them and put in the oven or on the side of the stove

and salt, and half a saltspoonful of pepper, mixed well together. When
they have become thoroughly warmed turn into a dish, and serve
immediately.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>


<p><b>APPLES AND ONIONS</b>&mdash;Select sour apples, pare, core and thinly slice.

with roast pork.</p>


<p><b>BACON AND SPINACH</b>&mdash;Line a pudding dish with thin slices of raw bacon.
Take boiled spinach, ready for the table, season with butter, salt and
pepper. Take also some boiled carrots, turnips and onions. Whip up the
yolk of an egg with pepper and salt, and stir into the carrots and
turnips. Arrange the vegetables alternately in the dish and partially
fill with boiling water. Steam for an hour. Turn out on a flat dish, and
serve with a rich brown gravy.</p>


<p><b>BOILED CELERY</b>&mdash;Trim off the tops of the celery about one-third of
their length, and also trim the roots into rounding shape. Save the tops
for making cream of celery and for garnishes, cook the celery in salted
water until tender, drain, lay on toast, and pour a cream sauce over.</p>


<p><b>BOSTON BAKED BEANS</b>&mdash;Pick over a quart of small pea beans, wash
thoroughly and soak over night in warm water. In the morning parboil
them until the skins crack open. Pour off the water. Put into the bottom
of a glazed earthenware pot, made expressly for the purpose, a pint of
hot water in which have been dissolved a half tablespoonful salt, two
tablespoonfuls molasses, a half teaspoonful mustard, and a pinch of
soda. Pack in the beans until about a third full, then place in it a
pound (or less, if preferred) of streaked pig pork, the skin of which
has been scored. Cover with a layer of beans, letting the rind of the
pork just show through. Now add enough more seasoned hot water to cover
the beans, and bake covered in a slow oven all day or night. When done
the beans should be soft, tender and moist but brown and whole, and the
pork cooked to a jelly.</p>


<p><b>BREADED POTATO BALLS</b>&mdash;Pare, boil and mash potatoes and whip into three
cups of potato three level tablespoons of butter, two tablespoons of hot
milk, salt and pepper to taste; also two teaspoons of onion juice and
two level tablespoons of chopped parsley, one-quarter cup of grated mild
cheese and two well-beaten eggs. Beat well and set aside to cool. Mold
into small balls, roll each in beaten egg, in fine stale breadcrumbs,
and then fry in deep hot fat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>


<p><b>CABBAGE AND CHEESE</b>&mdash;Boil the cabbage in two waters, then drain, cool
and chop. Season well with salt and pepper and spread a layer in a
buttered baking dish. Pour over this a white sauce made from a
tablespoonful each of flour and butter and a cup of milk. Add two or
three tablespoonfuls of finely broken cheese. Now add another layer of
cabbage, then more of the white sauce and cheese, and so on until all
the material is used. Sprinkle with fine crumbs, bake covered about half
an hour, then uncover and brown.</p>


<p><b>CAULIFLOWER AU GRATIN</b>&mdash;Select a firm, well-shaped cauliflower, and
after the preliminary soaking in cold salt water throw into a kettle of
boiling water and cook half an hour, until tender. Drain, pick off the
flowers and lay to one side, while you pick the stalks into small
pieces. Lay on the bottom of a rather shallow buttered baking dish,
sprinkle with pepper, grated cheese and cracker crumbs. Dot with pieces
of butter. Add a little milk, then a layer of the flowerets and another
sprinkling of milk, cheese and pepper.</p>


<p><b>CAULIFLOWER FRITTERS</b>&mdash;Soak and boil the cauliflower in the usual way,
then separate into flowers. Dip each piece into a thin batter, plunge
into boiling fat and fry a delicate brown. Serve very hot on napkins. If
preferred, the pieces may be dipped into a mixture of salt, pepper,
vinegar and oil, then fried.</p>


<p><b>CREAMED SPAGHETTI</b>&mdash;Have two quarts of water boiling in a kettle and
one-third of a pound of spaghetti. Hold a few pieces of the spaghetti at
a time in the water and as the ends soften turn them round and round and
down into the kettle. When all are in the water put on a cover and cook
the spaghetti twenty minutes, then drain.</p>

<p>Make a cream sauce with a rounding tablespoon each of flour and butter
and one cup of cream. Season with one-half teaspoon of salt and a few
grains of pepper. Stir in the spaghetti cut in inch pieces, turn on to a
dish, and sprinkle with finely grated cheese.</p>


<p><b>FRIED CORN</b>&mdash;Cut the corn off the cob, leaving the grains as separate
as possible. Fry in just enough butter to keep it from sticking to the
pan, stirring very often. When nicely browned add salt and pepper and a
little rich cream. Do not set near the fire after adding the cream.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>


<p><b>FRIED TOMATOES</b>&mdash;Wipe some smooth solid tomatoes and slice and fry in a
spider with butter or pork fat. Season well with salt and pepper.</p>


<p><b>GLAZED CARROTS WITH PEAS</b>&mdash;Wash, scrape and cut three medium-sized
carrots in one-fourth inch slices, then, in cubes or fancy shapes, drain
and put in saucepan with one-half cup butter, one-third cup sugar, and
one tablespoon fine chopped fresh mint leaves. Cook slowly until glazed
and tender. Drain and rinse one can French peas and heat in freshly
boiling water five minutes. Again drain and season with butter, salt and
pepper. Mound peas on hot dish and surround with carrots.</p>


<p><b>GLAZED SWEET POTATOES</b>&mdash;Put two rounding tablespoons of butter and one
of sugar into a casserole and set on the back of the range to heat
slowly. When hot lay in raw, pared sweet potatoes cut in halves,
lengthwise. Dust with salt and pepper and put in another layer of
seasoned potatoes and enough boiling water to stand one-half inch deep
in the dish. Put on the close-fitting cover and set in the oven to cook
slowly. When the potatoes are tender serve in the same dish with the
sweet sauce that will not be entirely absorbed in the cooking. This way
of preparing sweet potatoes pleases the Southern taste, which demands
sugar added to the naturally sweet vegetable.</p>


<p><b>GLAZED SWEET POTATOES</b>&mdash;Sweet potatoes, like squash and peas, lose a
little of their sweetness in cooking, and when recooked it is well to
add a little sugar. Slice two large cooked sweet potatoes and lay in a
small baking dish, sprinkle with a level tablespoon of sugar and a few
dashes of salt and pepper, add also some bits of butter. Pour in
one-half cup of boiling water, bake half an hour, basting twice with the
butter and water.</p>


<p><b>GREEN MELON SAUTE</b>&mdash;There are frequently a few melons left on the vines
which will not ripen sufficiently to be palatable uncooked. Cut them in
halves, remove the seeds and then cut in slices three-fourths of an inch
thick. Cut each slice in quarters and again, if the melon is large, pare
off the rind, sprinkle them slightly with salt and powdered sugar, cover
with fine crumbs; then dip in beaten egg, then in crumbs again, and cook
slowly in hot butter, the same as eggplant. Drain, and serve hot. When
the melons are nearly ripe they may be sauted in butter without crumbs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>


<p><b>JAPANESE OR CHINESE RICE</b>&mdash;Wash one cup of rice, rubbing it through
several waters until the water runs clear. Put in porcelain-lined
stewpan with a quart of soup stock and bay leaves and boil twenty
minutes. The stock must be hot when added to the rice. Shake the kettle
in which it is cooking several times during the cooking and lift
occasionally with a fork. Do not stir. Pour off any superfluous stock
remaining at the end of twenty minutes, and set on the back of the stove
or in the oven, uncovered, to finish swelling and steaming. Just before
serving add one cup of hot tomato juice, a quarter cup of butter, a
tablespoon chopped parsley, a dash of paprika, and one tablespoon of
grated cheese. Serve with grated cheese.</p>


<p><b>LIMA BEANS WITH NUTS</b>&mdash;Soak one cup of dry lima beans over night. In
the morning rip off the skins, rinse and put into the bean pot with
plenty of water and salt to season, rather more than without the nuts.
Let cook slowly in the oven and until perfectly tender; add one-half cup
of walnut meal, stirring it in well; let cook a few minutes, and serve.</p>


<p><b>MACARONI WITH APRICOTS</b>&mdash;Stew twenty halves of fresh apricots in half a
cup of sugar and enough water to make a nice sirup when they are done.
Before removing from the fire add a heaping tablespoonful of brown flour
and cook until the sirup is heavy and smooth. Parboil ten sticks of
macaroni broken in two-inch pieces, drain, add to one pint of scalding
hot milk two ounces of sugar. Throw in the parboiled macaroni and allow
it to simmer until the milk is absorbed; stir it often. Pour all the
juice or sauce from the apricots into the macaroni, cover the macaroni
well, set on back of the stove for fifteen minutes, then take off and
allow to cool. When cold form a pile of macaroni in the center of the
dish and cover with apricots, placing them in circles around and over
it.</p>


<p><b>MACARONI AND CHEESE</b>&mdash;Cook macaroni broken up into short length in
boiling salted water. Boil uncovered for twenty or thirty minutes, then
drain. Fill a buttered pudding dish with alternate layers of macaroni
and grated cheese, sprinkling pepper, salt and melted butter over each
layer. Have top layer of cheese, moisten with rich milk, bake in
moderate oven until a rich brown.</p>


<p><b>SCRAMBLED CAULIFLOWER</b>&mdash;Trim off the coarse outer leaves of a
cauliflower. After soaking and cooking, drain well and divide into
branches. Sprinkle with nutmeg, salt and pepper and toss into a frying
pan with hot butter or olive oil.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>


<p><b>MACARONI OR SPAGHETTI SERVED IN ITALIAN STYLE</b>&mdash;Break a pound of
macaroni or spaghetti into small pieces. Put into boiling salted water
and boil about twenty minutes. Then drain and arrange on platter.
Sprinkle on each layer grated cheese and mushroom sauce. Serve hot.</p>


<p><b>MUSHROOM SAUCE, ITALIAN STYLE</b>&mdash;(For macaroni, spaghetti, ravioli and
rice.)&mdash;A small piece of butter about the size of an egg. One or two
small onions, cut very small. About two pounds of beef. Let all brown.
Prepare as you would a pot roast. Add Italian dried mushrooms, soaked
over night in hot water, chopped in small pieces. Add about one-half can
of tomatoes. Let all cook well. Salt and pepper to taste. Add a little
flour to thicken.</p>


<p><b>MOLD SPINACH</b>&mdash;Remove roots and decayed leaves, wash in several waters
until no grit remains. Boil in water to nearly cover until tender,
drain, rinse in cold water, drain again, chop very fine; reheat in
butter, season with salt and pepper and pack in small cups. Turn out and
garnish with sifted yolk of egg.</p>


<p><b>NUT PARSNIP STEW</b>&mdash;Wash, scrape and slice thin two good-sized parsnips.
Cook until perfectly tender in two quarts of water. When nearly done add
a teaspoon of salt and when thoroughly done a teaspoon of flour mixed
with a little cold water, stir well and let boil until the flour is well
cooked, then stir in one-half cup of walnut meal, let boil up once, and
serve immediately.</p>


<p><b>POTATOES A LA MAITRE D'HOTEL</b>&mdash;Slice cold boiled potatoes thin. Melt a
rounding tablespoonful of butter in a saucepan, add a heaping pint bowl
of the potatoes, season with salt and pepper, and heat. Now add a
teaspoon of lemon juice and the same of finely minced parsley, and serve
at once.</p>


<p><b>POTATOES AU GRATIN</b>&mdash;Make a white sauce, using one tablespoonful of
butter, one of flour, one-half a teaspoonful salt, one-quarter of a
teaspoonful of white pepper and one cupful of milk. Cut cold boiled
potatoes into thick slices, or, better still, into half-inch cubes.
Butter a baking dish, put in it a layer of the sauce, then one of the
potatoes, previously lightly seasoning with salt and pepper. Continue
until all are in, the proportion of potato being about two cupfuls.</p>

<p>To one cupful of dried and sifted breadcrumbs, add one teaspoonful of
melted butter and stir until it is evenly mixed through. Spread this
over the contents of the baking dish, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> place in a quick oven for
twenty minutes, or until nicely browned. For a change, a little onion
juice, chopped parsley or grated cheese may be added to the sauce.</p>


<p><b>POTATO CREAMED</b>&mdash;Cut cold boiled potatoes into small dice and cover
them in a small saucepan with milk. Let them stand where they will heat
slowly and absorb nearly all the milk. When hot add to one pint of
potatoes a tablespoon of salt and a dash of white pepper. Sprinkle a
little finely chopped parsley over the top as a garnish.</p>


<p><b>POTATO MOLD</b>&mdash;Mash some potato smoothly, add to it some butter and a
little milk to make it smooth but not wet. Season with white pepper and
salt and add enough chopped parsley to make it look pretty. Press into
greased mold and bake for half an hour until lightly browned. Dust with
crumbs and serve.</p>


<p><b>POTATO PARISIENNE</b>&mdash;Potato marbles seasoned with minced parsley, butter
and lemon juice are liked by many. Others find that they are not
sufficiently seasoned, that is, the seasoning has not penetrated into
the potatoes, especially if a large cutter has been used. This method
will be found to remedy this fault, giving a seasoning which reaches
every portion of the potato. It may not be quite so attractive as the
somewhat underdone marbles, but the flavor is finer.</p>

<p>Pare the potatoes and steam or boil them until soft, being careful they
do not cook too fast. Drain off the water and let them stand uncovered
until dry. Then cut in quarters lengthwise, and then in thin slices,
letting them drop into a stewpan containing melted butter, salt and
paprika. When all are sliced cover them and let them heat for a few
minutes, add minced parsley and lemon Juice, shake them about so the
seasoning will be well mixed and serve at once.</p>


<p><b>POTATO PUFFS</b>&mdash;<b>No. 1</b>&mdash;To one cup of mashed potato add one tablespoon
of butter, one egg, beaten light, one-half cup of cream or milk, a
little salt. Beat well and fill popover pans half full. Bake until brown
in quick oven.</p>


<p><b>POTATO PUFFS</b>&mdash;<b>No. 2</b>&mdash;Add hot milk to cold mashed potato beat up
thoroughly. Add one or two well-beaten eggs, leaving out the yolks if
preferred whiter. Drop in spoonfuls on a buttered tin, place a piece of
butter on the top of each and bake a delicate brown or put in a pudding
dish and butter the top and bake till of a light brown on top. Fifteen
minutes in a hot oven will be sufficient.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>


<p><b>RICE A LA GEORGIENNE FOR FIVE PERSONS</b>&mdash;Wash one pound of rice in
several changes of cold water until water is clear, and cook until soft,
but not soft enough to mash between the fingers. Let it drip, cool and
drip again. Add it to one-quarter pound of melted butter, not browned,
season with salt and pepper. Mix thoroughly; bake in covered dish for
twenty minutes.</p>


<p><b>RICE IN TOMATOES</b>&mdash;Cook some rice in boiling salted water until tender
and season highly with pepper. Cut a small slice from the top of each
ripe tomato, take out the seeds, fill with the seasoned rice, put a bit
of butter on each, set in the oven and bake until the tomato is tender.</p>


<p><b>RICE SERVED IN ITALIAN STYLE WITH MUSHROOM SAUCE</b>&mdash;Steam or boil
one-half pound of rice until done, then drain. Remove meat from mushroom
sauce. Drop rice into mushroom sauce and cook about five minutes. Pour
on platter and sprinkle heavy with grated cheese.</p>


<p><b>SCALLOPED TOMATOES</b>&mdash;Drain a half can of tomatoes from some of their
liquor and season with salt, pepper, a few drops of onion juice and one
teaspoonful sugar. Cover the bottom of a small buttered baking dish with
buttered cracker crumbs, cover with tomatoes and sprinkle the top
thickly with buttered crumbs. Bake in a hot oven. Buttered cracker
crumbs are made by simply rolling common crackers with a rolling pin and
allowing one-third cupful of melted butter to each cupful of crumbs.
This recipe takes about one and one-third cupfuls of crumbs.</p>


<p><b>SPAGHETTI A L'ITALIENNE</b>&mdash;Let it cook until the water nearly boils away
and it is very soft. The imported spaghetti is so firm that it may be
cooked a long time without losing its shape. When the water has boiled
out, watch it and remove the cover so it will dry off. Then draw the
mass to one side and put in a large lump of butter, perhaps a
tablespoon, and let it melt, then stir in until the butter is absorbed,
and pour on one cup of the strained juice from canned tomatoes. Season
with salt and paprika, and let it stew until the spaghetti has absorbed
the tomato. The spaghetti, if cooked until soft, will thicken the tomato
sufficiently and it is less work than to make a tomato sauce. Turn out
and serve as an entree, or a main dish for luncheon and pass grated sap
sago or other cheese to those who prefer it. When you have any stock
like chicken or veal, add that with the tomato or alone if you prefer
and scant the butter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p><b>STUFFED CABBAGE</b>&mdash;Cut the stalk out of two or more young cabbages and
fill with a stuffing made from cooked veal, chopped or ground very fine,
seasoned well with salt and pepper, and mixed with the beaten yolk of an
egg. Tie a strip of cheese cloth round each cabbage, or if small, twine
will hold each together. Put into a kettle with boiling water to cover
and cook until tender. Drain, unbind and serve hot.</p>


<p><b>STUFFED EGG PLANT</b>&mdash;Wash a large egg plant, cut in halves the long way
and scoop the inside out with a teaspoon, leaving each shell quite
empty, but unbroken. Cook the inside portion in one-half cup of water,
then press through a strainer and mix with one-half cup of bread crumbs,
one rounding tablespoon of butter and season with salt and pepper. The
shells should lie in salt and water after scraping, and when ready to
fill them wipe them dry and pack the filling. Scatter fine crumbs over
the top, dot with butter and bake twenty minutes.</p>


<p><b>STUFFED POTATOES</b>&mdash;Select smooth, even sized potatoes and bake until
done. Remove one end, carefully scrape out the center of each mash and
season with salt and butter, add a generous portion of nut meat and fill
the shells with the mixture. Cover with the piece that was cut off, wrap
each potato in tissue paper and serve.</p>


<p><b>CORN STEWED WITH CREAM</b>&mdash;Select a half dozen ears of Indian corn,
remove the silks and outer husks, place them in a saucepan and cover
with water. Cook, drain, and cut the corn off the cobs with a sharp
knife, being very careful that none of the cob adheres to the corn.
Place in a stewpan with one cup of hot bechamel sauce, one-half
breakfast-cupful of cream and about one-quarter of an ounce of butter.
Season with pepper and salt and a little grated nutmeg. Cook gently on a
stove for five minutes, place in a hot dish and serve.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

from the stem end. Grate on a coarse grater and drain through cheese
cloth for half an hour. Season the pulp with salt, pepper and vinegar to
suit the taste. Serve with broiled, baked or fried fish.</p>


<p><b>GHERKIN SAUCE</b>&mdash;Put a sprig of thyme, a bay-leaf, a clove of garlic,
two finely chopped shallots, and a cayenne pepper, and salt into a
saucepan, with one breakfast cup of vinegar. Place pan on fire and when
contents have boiled for thirty minutes, add a breakfast cup of stock or
good broth. Strain it through a fine hair sieve and stir in one and
one-half ounces of liquefied butter mixed with a little flour to thicken
it. Place it back in the saucepan and when it boils stir in it a
teaspoonful or so of parsley very finely chopped, two or three ounces of
pickle gherkins, and a little salt if required.</p>


<p><b>GIBLET SAUCE</b>&mdash;Put the giblets from any bird in the saucepan with
sufficient stock or water to cover them and boil for three hours, adding
an onion and a few peppercorns while cooking. Take them out, and when
they are quite tender strain the liquor into another pan and chop up the
gizzards, livers, and other parts into small pieces. Take a little of
the thickening left at the bottom of the pan in which a chicken or goose
has been braised, and after the fat has been taken off, mix it with the
giblet liquor and boil until dissolved. Strain the sauce, put in the
pieces of giblet, and serve hot.</p>


<p><b>GOOSEBERRY SAUCE</b>&mdash;Pick one pound of green gooseberries and put them
into a saucepan with sufficient water to keep them from burning, when
soft mash them, grate in a little nutmeg and sweeten to taste with moist
sugar. This sauce may be served with roast pork or goose instead of
apple sauce. It may also be served with boiled mackerel. A small piece
of butter will make the sauce richer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>


<p><b>HALF-GLAZE SAUCE</b>&mdash;Put one pint of clear concentrated veal gravy in a
saucepan, mix it with two wine-glassfuls of Madeira, a bunch of sweet
herbs, and set both over the fire until boiling. Mix two tablespoonfuls
of potato flour to a smooth paste with a little cold water, then mix it
with the broth and stir until thick. Move the pan to the side of the
fire and let the sauce boil gently until reduced to two-thirds of its
original quantity. Skim it well, pass it through a silk sieve, and it is
ready for use.</p>


<p><b>HAM SAUCE</b>&mdash;After a ham is nearly all used up pick the small quantity
of meat still remaining, from the bone, scrape away the uneatable parts
and trim off any rusty bits from the meat, chop the bone very small and
beat the meat almost to a paste. Put the broken bones and meat together
into a saucepan over a slow fire, pour over them one-quarter pint of
broth, and stir about one-quarter of an hour, add to it a few sweet
herbs, a seasoning of pepper and one-half pint of good beef stock. Cover
the saucepan and stir very gently until well flavored with herbs, then
strain it. A little of this added to any gravy is an improvement.</p>


<p><b>HORSERADISH SAUCE</b>&mdash;Place in a basin one tablespoonful of moist sugar,
one tablespoonful of ground mustard, one teacupful of grated
horseradish, and one teaspoonful of turmeric, season with pepper and
salt and mix the ingredients with a teacupful of vinegar or olive oil.
When quite smooth, turn the sauce into a sauceboat, and it is ready to
be served.</p>


<p><b>LEMON BUTTER</b>&mdash;Cream four level tablespoons of butter and add gradually
one tablespoon of lemon juice mixing thoroughly.</p>


<p><b>LEMON SAUCE FOR FISH</b>&mdash;Squeeze and strain the juice of a large lemon
into a lined saucepan, put in with it one-fourth pound butter and
pepper, and salt to taste. Beat it over the fire until thick and hot,
but do not allow to boil. When done mix with sauce the beaten yolks of
two eggs. It is then ready to be served.</p>


<p><b>LOBSTER BUTTER</b>&mdash;Take the head and spawn of some hen lobsters, put them
in a mortar and pound, add an equal quantity of fresh butter, and pound
both together, being sure they are thoroughly mixed. Pass this through a
fine hair sieve, and the butter is then ready for use. It is very nice
for garnishing or for making sandwiches.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>


<p><b>MAITRE D'HOTEL BUTTER</b>&mdash;Cream one-fourth cup of butter. Add one-half
teaspoon salt, a dash of pepper and a tablespoon of fine chopped
parsley, then, very slowly to avoid curdling, a tablespoon of lemon
juice. This sauce is appropriate for beefsteak and boiled fish.</p>


<p><b>SAUCE A LA METCALF</b>&mdash;Put two or three tablespoonfuls of butter in a
saucepan, and when it melts add about a tablespoonful of Liebig's
Extract of Beef; season and gradually stir in about a cupful of cream.
After taking off, add a wine-glassful of Sherry or Madeira.</p>


<p><b>PARSLEY AND LEMON SAUCE</b>&mdash;Squeeze the juice from a lemon, remove the
pips, and mince fine the pulp and rind. Wash a good handful of parsley,
and shake it as dry as possible, and chop it, throwing away the stalks.
Put one ounce of butter and one tablespoonful of flour into a saucepan,
and stir over fire until well mixed. Then put in the parsley and minced
lemon, and pour in as much clear stock as will be required to make the
sauce. Season with a small quantity of pounded mace, and stir the whole
over the fire a few minutes. Beat the yolks of two eggs with two
tablespoonfuls of cold stock, and move the sauce to the side of the
fire, and when it has cooled a little, stir in the eggs. Stir the sauce
for two minutes on the side of the fire, and it will be ready for
serving.</p>


<p><b>POIVRADE SAUCE</b>&mdash;Put in a stewpan six scallions, a little thyme, a good
bunch of parsley, two bay-leaves, a dessert-spoonful of white pepper,
two tablespoons of vinegar and two ounces of butter, and let all stew
together until nearly all the liquor has evaporated; add one teacupful
of stock, two teacupfuls of Spanish sauce. Boil this until reduced to
one-half, then serve.</p>


<p><b>ROYAL SAUCE</b>&mdash;Put four ounces of fresh butter and the yolks of two
fresh eggs into a saucepan and stir them over the fire until the yolks
begin to thicken, but do not allow them to cook hard. Take sauce off the
fire and stir in by degrees two tablespoonfuls of tarragon vinegar, two
tablespoons of Indian soy, one finely chopped green gherkin, one small
pinch of cayenne pepper, and a small quantity of salt. When well
incorporated keep sauce in a cold place. When cold serve with fish.</p>


<p><b>SAUCE FOR FISH</b>&mdash;Simmer two cups of milk with a slice of onion, a slice
of carrot cut in bits, a sprig of parsley and a bit of bay-leaf for a
few minutes. Strain onto one-quarter cup of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> butter rubbed smooth with
the same flour. Cook five minutes and season with a level teaspoon of
salt and a saltspoon of pepper.</p>


<p><b>SAUCE MAYONNAISE</b>&mdash;Place in an earthen bowl a couple of fresh egg yolks
and one-half teaspoonful of ground English mustard, half pinch of salt,
one-half saltspoonful red pepper, and stir well for about three minutes
without stopping, then pour in, one drop at a time, one and one-half
cupfuls of best olive oil, and should it become too thick, add a little
at a time some good vinegar, stirring constantly.</p>


<p><b>SAUCE TARTARE</b>&mdash;Use one-half level teaspoon of salt and mustard, one
teaspoon of powdered sugar, and a few grains of cayenne beaten
vigorously with the yolks of two eggs. Add one-half cup of olive oil
slowly and dilute as needed with one and one-half tablespoon of vinegar.
Add one-quarter cup of chopped pickles, capers and olives mixed.</p>


<p><b>TARTAR SAUCE</b>&mdash;Mix one tablespoon of vinegar, one teaspoon of lemon
juice, a saltspoon of salt, a tablespoon of any good catsup and heat
over hot water. Heat one-third cup of butter in a small saucepan until
it begins to brown, then strain onto the other ingredients and pour over
the fish on the platter.</p>


<p><b>SHRIMP SAUCE</b>&mdash;Pour one pint of poivrade sauce and butter sauce into a
saucepan and boil until somewhat reduced. Thicken the sauce with two
ounces of lobster butter. Pick one and one-half pints of shrimps, put
them into the sauce with a small quantity of lemon juice, stir the sauce
by the side of the fire for a few minutes, then serve it.</p>


<p><b>SAUCE FOR FRIED PIKE</b>&mdash;Peel and chop very fine one small onion, one
green pepper, half a peeled clove, and garlic. Season with salt, red
pepper and half a wine-glassful of good white wine. Boil about two
minutes and add a gill of tomato sauce and a small tomato cut in dice
shaped pieces. Cook about ten minutes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p><b>BREAKFAST ROLLS</b>&mdash;Sift a quart of flour and stir into it a saltspoonful
of sugar, a cup of warm milk, two tablespoonfuls of melted shortening
and two beaten eggs. Dissolve a quarter of a cake of compressed yeast in
a little warm milk and beat in last of all. Set the dough in a bowl to
rise until morning. Early in the morning make lightly and quickly into
rolls and set to rise near the range for twenty minutes.</p>


<p><b>EGG ROLLS</b>&mdash;Two cups flour, one level teaspoon salt, two level
teaspoons baking powder, two level tablespoons lard, two level
tablespoons butter, one egg, one-half cup milk. Sift together the flour,
salt, and baking powder, work in the shortening with the fingers.</p>

<p>Add the egg well beaten and mixed with the milk. Mix well, toss onto a
floured board and knead lightly. Roll out and cut in two-inch squares.
Place a half-inch apart in a buttered pan. Gash the center of each with
a sharp knife. Brush over with sugar and water, and bake fifteen minutes
in a hot oven.</p>


<p><b>EXCELLENT TEA ROLLS</b>&mdash;Scald one cup of milk and turn into the mixing
bowl. When nearly cool add a whole yeast cake and beat in one and a half
cups of flour. Cover and let rise. Add one-quarter cup of sugar, one
level teaspoon of salt, two beaten eggs, and one-third cup of butter.
Add flour enough to make a dough that can be kneaded. Cover and let
rise. Roll out one-half inch thick, cut in rounds, brush one-half each
with melted butter, fold and press together. Set close together in the
pan, cover with a cloth, let rise, and bake.</p>

double boiler, add one rounding tablespoon of butter, one level
tablespoon of sugar, and one level teaspoon of salt. Stir and set into
cold water until lukewarm, then add one yeast cake dissolved in
one-quarter cup of lukewarm water, and two cups of flour. Beat hard for
two or three minutes, cover,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> and let rise until very light. Add flour

cup of lukewarm water. Cover and let rise over night. In the morning
roll half an inch thick cut into rounds, spread a little soft butter on
one-half of each, fold over and press together. Let rise until light and
bake in a quick oven. Rolls may be raised lighter than a loaf of bread
because the rising is checked as soon as they are put into the oven.</p>


<p><b>RAISED GRAHAM ROLLS</b>&mdash;Scald two cups of milk and melt in it two level
tablespoons of butter and one-half level teaspoon of salt. When cool add

smooth and set in a warm place until light. When well risen stir in
whole meal to make a dough just stiff enough to knead. Knead until
elastic then place it in the original bulk. Flour the board and turn the
risen dough out carefully, pat out one inch thick with the rolling pin
and make into small rolls. Place these rolls close together in the pan,

the meal in a baking dish with a teaspoonful of salt. Pour in little by
little just enough cold water to make a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> dough and roll out quickly
before it hardens into a circular sheet about a quarter of an inch
thick. Cut into four cakes and bake slowly for about twenty minutes on
an iron griddle. Do not turn but toast after they are cooked.</p>

of scalded milk, a teaspoon of salt, yeast and flour. In the morning put
half a cup of butter into two cups of milk and heat until the butter is
barely melted, add this to the sponge, one cup of sugar and three beaten
eggs. Add flour to make a dough that can be kneaded. Let rise very
light. Roll out one and one-half inches thick, cut in round cakes, let

<p><b>WHOLE WHEAT POPOVERS</b>&mdash;Put two-thirds cup of whole wheat meal, one and
two-thirds cup of white flour, and one-half level teaspoon of salt into
a sifter and sift three times. Pour two cups of milk on slowly and stir
until smooth. Beat two eggs five minutes, add to the first mixture, and

rolled in flour. Bake in muffin pans twenty minutes.</p>


<p><b>BUTTERMILK MUFFINS</b>&mdash;Sift four cups of flour, one-quarter cup of
cornmeal, and one level teaspoon each of salt and soda three times. Beat

family.</p>


<p><b>ENGLISH MUFFINS</b>&mdash;One pint milk, two level tablespoons shortening
(butter or lard), two level teaspoons sugar, one level teaspoon salt,
one yeast cake dissolved in one-fourth cup lukewarm water, flour. Scald
the milk and add the shortening, sugar, and salt. When lukewarm add the
yeast and sufficient flour to make a good batter. Here one's judgment
must be used. Beat well and let rise until double in bulk. Warm and
butter a griddle and place on it buttered muffin rings. Fill not quite
half full of the batter, cover and cook slowly until double, then heat
the griddle quickly and cook for about ten minutes, browning nicely
underneath. Then turn them and brown the other side. When cool split,
toast and butter.</p>

fill hot buttered gem pans two-thirds full, and bake in a hot oven.</p>


<p><b>QUICK MUFFINS IN RINGS</b>&mdash;Beat two eggs, yolks and whites separately.
Add to the yolks two cups of milk, one level<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> teaspoon of salt, one
tablespoon of melted butter and two cups of flour in which two level
teaspoons of baking powder have been sifted, and last the stiffly beaten
whites of the eggs. When well mixed bake in greased muffin rings on a
hot griddle. Turn over when risen and set, as both sides must be
browned.</p>


<p><b>BOILED RICE MUFFINS</b>&mdash;To make muffins with cooked rice, sift two and
one-quarter cups of flour twice with five level teaspoons of baking
powder, one rounding tablespoon of sugar, and a saltspoon of salt. Put

milk. Add one-half teaspoonful of soda dissolved in warm water. Turn
into a well buttered mold which may be a five-pound lard pail, if no
other mold is handy. Set on something that will keep mold from bottom of
kettle and turn enough boiling water to come half way up on the mold.
Cover the kettle and keep the kettle boiling steadily for three and
one-half hours. If water boils away add enough boiling water to keep the
same amount of water in kettle. Put in molds and cut when cool.</p>


<p><b>CRISP WHITE CORNCAKE</b>&mdash;Two cups scalded milk, one cup white cornmeal,
two level teaspoons salt. Mix the salt and cornmeal and add gradually
the hot milk. When well mixed, pour into a buttered dripping pan and
bake in a moderate oven until crisp. Serve cut in squares. The mixture
should not be more than one-fourth inch deep when poured into pan.</p>


<p><b>CROUTONS</b>&mdash;Croutons made coarsely are no addition to a soup. For the
best sort, cut out stale bread into half-inch slices, spread with
butter, then trim away the crust. Cut into small cubes, put into a pan
and set in a hot oven. If the croutons incline to brown unevenly shake
the pan.</p>

pan for three-quarters of an hour.</p>


<p><b>OATMEAL BREAD</b>&mdash;Over a pint of rolled oats pour a quart of boiling
water. When cool add one teaspoonful suet, one teaspoon butter, one-half
cup molasses and one-half yeast cake dissolved in a little water. Stir
this thoroughly and then add two quarts sifted flour. Do not knead this
and allow it to rise over night, and in the morning stir it again, and
then put it in well buttered bread pans: let it rise until it fills the
pans and then bake in a moderate oven. It takes a little longer to bake
than white bread.</p>


<p><b>OATMEAL BREAD</b>&mdash;Cook one cup of rolled oats in water for serving at
breakfast, and one cup of molasses, one and one-half cups of lukewarm
water in which is dissolved one yeast cake and one teaspoon of salt. Mix
in enough flour to make a stiff dough, cover and let rise. When very
light stir down, put in pans, let rise light and bake in a slow oven.

of sugar and three of molasses. Now add two cupfuls of cold water
(making six cups of water in all) and, if cool enough, add one yeast
cake dissolved in a very little water. Now stir in all the white flour
it will take until it is as stiff as you can manage it with the spoon.
Set in warm place over night, and in the morning with spoon and knife
fill your tins part full, let rise to nearly top of pan, then bake an
hour for medium size loaves.</p>


<p><b>RAISIN BREAD</b>&mdash;Scald three cups of milk and add one teaspoon of salt
and two tablespoons of sugar. Cool and add one-half yeast cake,
dissolved in one-quarter cup of lukewarm water. Mix in enough flour to
make a drop batter and set to rise. When this sponge is light put in two
cups of seeded raisins and enough<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> flour to make a soft dough, but stiff
enough to knead. Let rise again, then mold into two loaves. Let the
loaves double in size and bake slowly, covering with another pan for the
first twenty minutes of baking.</p>


<p><b>STEAMED BROWN BREAD</b>&mdash;Beat one egg light, add one cup of cornmeal, one
cup rye-meal and one and one-half cups of flour sifted with a half level
teaspoon of salt. Add one cup of molasses, and after it is turned out

the other one-third cup more of the water. Pour into well buttered mold
and steam four hours.</p>


<p><b>SOUTHERN CORNCAKE</b>&mdash;Mix two cups of white cornmeal, a rounding
tablespoon of sugar and a level teaspoon of salt, then pour enough hot
milk or milk and water to moisten the meal well, but not to make it of a
soft consistency. Let stand until cool, then add three well beaten eggs
and spread on a buttered shallow pan about half an inch thick. Bake in a
quick oven, cut in squares, split and butter while hot.</p>


<p><b>STEAMED CORN BREAD</b>&mdash;Sift together one cup cornmeal and flour and a
level teaspoon of salt. Put one level teaspoon soda in one tablespoon of
water, add to one-half cup of molasses and stir into the meal with one
and two-thirds cups of milk. Beat and turn into a greased mold. Steam
four hours, take off the lid of the mold and set in the oven fifteen
minutes.</p>


<p><b>STEAMED GRAHAM BREAD</b>&mdash;Put into a mixing bowl two cups of sour milk,
one cup of molasses, one level teaspoon of salt, two of soda and then
enough graham flour to make a batter as stiff as can be stirred with a
spoon, adding one-half cup of seeded raisins. Pour into a two-quart mold
or lard pail well greased, cover closely and set in a kettle of boiling
water that comes two-thirds the depth of the mold. Cover the kettle and
keep the water boiling constantly for four hours.</p>


<p><b>WHOLE WHEAT BREAD</b>&mdash;Scald one cupful of milk and one teaspoonful of
butter, one of salt, one cup of water and one tablespoonful of sugar.
When lukewarm add half a cake of compressed yeast dissolved in a little
water and enough wheat flour to make a thin batter. Beat vigorously
until smooth and let rise until very light. Add as much whole wheat
flour as you can beat in with a spoon. Pour into greased tins, let rise
until light and bake in moderate oven for one hour.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

cup of cooked asparagus tips and cool. Add one beaten egg and cook on a
hot buttered griddle in small cakes.</p>


<p><b>CORN FRITTERS</b>&mdash;One-half can corn, one-half cup flour, one-half level
teaspoon baking powder, one level teaspoon salt, a dash of cayenne and
one egg. Chop the corn fine and add the flour, sifted with the baking
powder, salt and cayenne. Add the egg yolk, well beaten and fold in the
white beaten stiff. Drop by spoonfuls into hot fat one-half inch deep.
Turn once while cooking. When done, drain on brown paper and serve.</p>


<p><b>CRUMB GRIDDLE CAKES</b>&mdash;Soak one pint of bread crumbs in one pint of sour
milk for an hour, then add a level teaspoon of soda dissolved in one cup
of sweet milk, and one well beaten egg, half a teaspoon of salt and
flour enough to make a drop batter as thick as griddle cakes are usually
made.</p>


<p><b>HOMINY CAKES</b>&mdash;To two cups of boiled hominy add two tablespoons of
melted butter. Break the whole very fine with spoon or fork. Add two
well beaten eggs, one-third teaspoon of salt, and a saltspoon of pepper.
Form into little cakes, after adding enough milk to make it of the right
consistency to handle. Set cakes on buttered dish and dust with a little
finely grated cheese. Bake in hot oven and serve at once.</p>


<p><b>OATMEAL CAKE</b>&mdash;Mix fine oatmeal into a stiff dough with milk-warm
water, roll it to the thinness almost of a wafer, bake on a griddle or
iron plate placed over a slow fire for three or four minutes, then place
it on edge before the fire to harden. This will be good for months, if
kept in a dry place.</p>


<p><b>PINEAPPLE PANCAKES</b>&mdash;Make a batter using half pound sifted flour and
three good sized eggs with a cupful of milk. This makes a very thin
batter. When smooth and free from lumps, bake in a well buttered frying
pan, making the cakes about eight inches in diameter. As soon as brown
on one side turn. When cooked on both sides remove to a hot serving dish
and sprinkle with sweetened pineapple. Bake the remainder of batter in
the same way, piling in layers with the pineapple between the cakes. Cut
in triangular pieces like pie and serve very hot.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p><b>A GOOD CRUST FOR GREAT PIES</b>&mdash;To a peck of flour, add the yolks of
three eggs. Boil some water, put in half a pound of fried suet and a
pound and a half of butter. Skim off the butter and suet and as much of
the liquor as will make a light crust. Mix well and roll out.</p>


<p><b>CRUST FOR CUSTARDS</b>&mdash;Take a half pound of flour, six ounces of butter,
the yolks of two eggs, three spoonfuls of cream. Mix well and roll very
thin.</p>


<p><b>DRIPPING CRUST</b>&mdash;Take a pound and a half of beef drippings; boil in
water, strain and let it get cold, taking off the hard fat. Scrape off
and boil it four or five times; then work it up well into three pounds
of flour, then add enough cold water to make dough, just stiff enough to
roll. This makes a very fine crust.</p>


<p><b>PASTE FOR TARTS</b>&mdash;One pound of flour, three-quarters of a pound of
butter and just enough cold water to mix together. Beat well with a
rolling pin.</p>


<p><b>PUFF PASTE</b>&mdash;Take a quarter of a peck of flour, rub in a pound of
butter, make it up into a light paste with a little cold waters, just
stiff enough to handle; then roll out to about the thickness of a crown
piece. Spread over with butter and sprinkle over with flour, then double
up and roll out again. Double and roll out seven or eight times. It is
then fit for all kinds of pies and tarts that require a puff paste.</p>


<p><b>APPLE PIE</b>&mdash;Make up a puff paste crust and lay some around the sides of
a dish. Pare and quarter apples. Put a layer of apples in the dish,
sprinkle with sugar, and add a little lemon peel, cut up fine, a little
lemon juice, a few cloves; then the rest of the apples, sugar and so on.
Sweeten to taste. Boil the peels and cores of the apples in a little
water, strain and boil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> the syrup with a little sugar. Pour over the
apples. Put on the upper crust and bake. A little quince or marmalade
may be used, if desired.</p>

<p>Pears may be used instead of apples, omitting the quince or marmalade.</p>

<p>Pies may be buttered when taken from oven. If a sauce is desired, beat
up the yolks of two eggs, add half pint of cream, little nutmeg and
sugar. Put over a slow fire, stirring well until it just boils up. Take
off the upper crust and pour the sauce over the pie, replacing the
crust.</p>


<p><b>APPLE PIE&mdash;SOUTHERN STYLE</b>&mdash;For four pies half pound butter, quarter
pound of lard, half dinner teaspoon of salt, work four cups flour and
the above ingredients with a fork, and then mix with ice water and mix
it so it will just stick together. Then ready for use.</p>


<p><b>BEATEN CREAM PIE</b>&mdash;Line a plate with good paste, prick in several
places to prevent rising out of shape. Bake and spread over some jelly
or jam about half an inch thick, and cover with one cup of cream beaten
stiff with two rounding tablespoons of powdered sugar and flavored with
one teaspoon of vanilla.</p>


<p><b>LARGE LEMON PIE</b>&mdash;Mix three level teaspoons of corn starch smooth in a
little cold water, and stir into three cups of boiling water. Cook five

of three eggs. Cook until the egg thickens, take from the fire and cool.
Line a large pie plate with paste and gash it in several places to
prevent rising unevenly, bake and fill with the mixture. Cover with a
meringue made from the white of three eggs beaten with six level
tablespoons of powdered sugar. Set in the oven to color.</p>


<p><b>LEMON PIE</b>&mdash;This is an old fashion pie, because it is baked between two
crusts, yet many have called it the best of all kinds. Grate the yellow
rind of two lemons, take off all the white skin and chop the remainder
very fine, discarding all the seeds. Add two cups of sugar and two
beaten eggs. Mix well and pour into a paste lined plate cover, and bake
thirty minutes.</p>


<p><b>NUT MINCE PIES</b>&mdash;One cup of walnut meats chopped fine, two cups of
chopped apple, one cup of raisins, one and one-half cups of sugar mixed
with one teaspoon each of cinnamon and allspice and one-half teaspoon
each of cloves and salt, one-half cup of vinegar and one-half cup of
water or fruit juice. Mix thoroughly. This quantity makes two large
pies.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p><b>PINEAPPLE CREAM PIE</b>&mdash;One-half cup butter, one cup sugar, one can
shredded pineapple, one-half cup milk, two eggs. Cream the butter, add
gradually the sugar, then the pineapple, milk and eggs well beaten. Mix
well and bake in one crust like custard pie. When cool cover with a
meringue or with whipped cream sweetened and flavored with vanilla.</p>


<p><b>PLAIN PIE PASTE</b>&mdash;Sift one and one-half cups of flour with a saltspoon
of salt and rub in one-quarter cup of lard. Moisten with very cold water
until a stiff dough is formed. Pat out and lay on one-quarter cup of
cold butter rolled out in a sheet. Fold in three layers, turn half way
round, and pat out again. Fold and roll twice more. This will make one
large pie with two crusts.</p>


<p><b>CHERRY PIE</b>&mdash;Make a good crust, lining the sides of a pie pan. Place
stoned cherries, well sweetened, in the pan and cover with upper crust.
Bake in slow oven. (A few red currants may be added to the cherries if
desired.)</p>

<p>Plums or gooseberry pies may be made in the same way.</p>


<p><b>CHERRY PIE</b>&mdash;Roll two large soda crackers into fine dust and stone
cherries enough to measure two cups. Line a pie plate with good rich
paste and scatter one-half cup of sugar over. Sprinkle one-half of the
cracker dust, and over that one-half of the cherries. Repeat the three
layers, pour on one cup of cherry juice and cold water, cover with paste
and bake in a moderate oven.</p>


<p><b>FRESH RASPBERRY PIE</b>&mdash;Line a pie plate with rich paste, fill with
raspberries and scatter on sugar to sweeten. Cover with a crust and bake
in a quick oven. When done draw from the oven, cut a gash in the top,
and pour in the following mixture: The yolks of two eggs beaten light
with a tablespoon of sugar and mixed with one cup of hot thin cream. Set
back in the oven for five minutes.</p>


<p><b>GREEN CURRANT PIE</b>&mdash;Stew and mash a pint of rather green currants,
sweeten abundantly, add a sprinkling of flour or a rolled cracker and
bake with two crusts. Dust generously with powdered sugar.</p>


<p><b>GREEN TOMATO PIE</b>&mdash;Take green tomatoes not yet turned and peel and
slice wafer thin. Fill a plate nearly full, add a tablespoonful vinegar
and plenty of sugar, dot with bits of butter and flavor with nutmeg or
lemon. Bake in one or two crusts as preferred.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>


<p><b>LEMON CREAM PIE</b>&mdash;Stir into one cup of boiling water one tablespoonful
of cornstarch dissolved in a little cold water. Cook until thickened and
clear, then add one cup of sugar, a teaspoonful of butter, and the juice
and grated rind of two lemons. Add the beaten yolks of three eggs and
take from the fire. Have ready the bottom crust of a pie that has been
baked, first pricking with a fork to prevent blisters. Place the custard
in the crust and bake half an hour. When done take from the oven and
spread over the top a meringue made from the stiffly whipped whites of
the eggs, and three tablespoonfuls of sugar. Shut off the oven so it
will be as cool as possible giving the meringue plenty of time to rise,
stiffen and color to a delicate gold.</p>


<p><b>APPLE FRITTERS</b>&mdash;Beat the yolks of eight eggs and the white of four
together. Add a quart of cream. Put over a fire and heat until you can
bear your finger in it. Add quarter of a pint of sack, three-quarters of
a pint of ale and make a posset of it. When cool put in nutmeg, ginger,
salt and flour. The batter should be pretty thick. Add pippins, sliced
or scraped and fry in deep fat.</p>


<p><b>APPLE SLUMP</b>&mdash;Fill a deep baking dish with apples, pared, cored and
sliced. Scatter on a little cinnamon and cover with good paste rolled a
little thicker than for pie. Bake in a moderate oven until the apples
are done, serve in the same dish, cutting the crust into several
sections. Before cutting, the crust may be lifted and the apples
seasoned with butter and sugar, or the seasoning may be added after
serving. A liquid or a hard sauce may be served with the slump. If the
apples are a kind that do not cook easily bake half an hour, then put on
the crust and set back in the oven.</p>


<p><b>BREAD PUFFS WITH SAUCE</b>&mdash;When bread dough is raised light, cut off
small pieces and pull out two or three inches long. Fry like doughnuts
in deep fat and put into a deep dish, turn over the puffs a cream sauce
seasoned with salt and pepper.</p>


<p><b>CHERRY DUMPLINGS</b>&mdash;Sift two cups of pastry flour with four level
teaspoons of baking powder and a saltspoon of salt. Mix with
three-quarters cup of milk or enough to make a soft dough. Butter some
cups well, put a tablespoon of dough in each, then a large tablespoon of
stoned cherries and another tablespoon of dough. Set in a steamer or set
the cups in a pan of hot water and into the oven to cook half an hour.

several hours. Cook in the same water. When very tender rub them through
a sieve. To one cup of the pulp add one tablespoon of lemon juice, the
yolks of two eggs beaten with one-half cup of thin cream and a few
grains of salt. Mix well and sweeten to taste, then fold in the whites
of two eggs beaten very stiff. Line small tins with paste, fill with the
mixture and bake in a moderate oven. Serve cold.</p>


<p><b>RASPBERRY DUMPLINGS</b>&mdash;Wash one cup of rice and put into the double
boiler. Pour over it two cups of boiling water, add one-half teaspoon of
salt and two tablespoons of sugar and cook thirty minutes or until soft.
Have some small pudding cloths about twelve inches square, wring them
out of hot water and lay them over a small half pint bowl. Spread the
rice one-third of an inch thick over the cloth, and fill the center with
fresh raspberries. Draw the cloth around until the rice covers the
berries and they are a good round shape. Tie the ends of the cloth
firmly, drop them into boiling water and cook twenty minutes. Remove the
cloth and serve with lemon sauce.</p>


<p><b>TART SHELLS</b>&mdash;Roll out thin a nice puff paste, cut with a small biscuit
cutter. With cutter take out the centers of two or three of these, lay
the rings thus made on the third and bake immediately. Shells may also
be made by lining pattypans with the paste; if the paste is light the
shells will be fine and may be used for tarts or oyster patties. Filled
with jelly and covered with meringue (a tablespoonful of sugar to the
white of an egg), and browned in the oven.</p>


<p><b>BAVARIAN CREAM</b>&mdash;Soak one-quarter of a box of gelatin in cold water

add two-thirds cup of flour and one-half teaspoon of lemon flavoring.
Drop in teaspoonfuls on a buttered sheet, allowing plenty of room to
spread in baking. Bake in a moderate oven, take up with a knife, and
roll at once into lily shape. Bake but four or five at a time because if
the cakes cool even a little they will break. Fill each with a little
beaten and sweetened cream.</p>


<p><b>COCOA CUSTARD</b>&mdash;For three cups of milk allow four teaspoons of cocoa,
three beaten eggs, three tablespoons of sugar, and three-quarters

put into double boiler with the milk. Scald until a good coffee color
and flavor is obtained, then remove from the fire. Remove the coffee.
Beat the eggs and add the sugar, salt and vanilla, then pour on
gradually the milk. Strain into cups, place in a pan of hot water, and
bake in a moderate oven until firm in the middle. Less vanilla is
required when combined with another flavoring.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CANDIES" id="CANDIES"></a>CANDIES</h2>


<p><b>CANDIED VIOLETS</b>&mdash;Gather the required quantity of perfect sweet
violets, white or blue. If possible, pick in the early morning while the
dew is still on them. Spread on an inverted sieve and stand in the air
until dried, but not crisp. Make a sirup, using a half pound of pure
granulated sugar and a half pint of water. Cook without stirring until
it spins a thread. Take each violet by the stem, dip into the hot sirup
and return to the sieve, which should be slightly oiled. Leave for
several hours. If the flowers then look preserved and clear they will
not require a second dipping, but if they appear dry as if some portions
of the petals were not properly saturated, dip again. Now have ready a
half cupful of melted fondant. Add a drop or two of violet extract and a
few drops of water to reduce the fondant to a thin, grayish, paste-like
consistency. Dip the flowers in this one at a time, dust with powdered
crystallized sugar, and lay on oiled paper to harden. Rose leaves may he
candied in the same way, substituting essence of rose for the violet and
a drop or two of cochineal to make the required color. A candy dipper or
fine wire can be used for dipping the rose petals.</p>


<p><b>CREAMED WALNUTS</b>&mdash;Cook two cups of sugar and one-half cup of water
together until the sirup threads. Add a teaspoon of vanilla, take from
the range and beat until thick and creamy. Make small balls of the candy
and press half a walnut meat into each side. Drop on to a plate of
granulated sugar.</p>


<p><b>CRYSTALLIZED COWSLIPS</b>&mdash;These make a prized English confection, much
used for ornamenting fancy desserts. The flowers are gathered when in
full bloom, washed gently and placed on a screen to dry. When this is
accomplished the stems are cut to within two inches of the head and the
flowers are then laid heads down on the tray of the crystallizing tin,
pushing the stalks through so the flowers shall be upright. When full<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
put the tray in the deep tin and fill with the same crystallizing sirup,
pouring around the sides and not over the flowers. When dry, arrange in
baskets or use in decorating.</p>


<p><b>FRUIT PASTE</b>&mdash;Take equal weights of nut meats, figs, dates and prepared
seedless raisins. Wipe the figs and remove the stems, remove the scales
and stones from the dates. Mix well and chop fine or run it all through
a meat chopper. Mold it on a board in confectioners' sugar until you
have a smooth, firm paste. Roll out thin and cut into inch squares or
small rounds. Roll the edge in sugar, then pack them away in layers with
paper between the layers.</p>


<p><b>GLACE FIGS</b>&mdash;Make a sirup by boiling together two cups of sugar and one
and a half cups of water. Wash and add as many figs as can be covered by
the sirup. Cook until they are tender and yellow, then remove from the
fire and let them stand in the sirup over night. In the morning cook for
thirty minutes, and again let them stand over night. Then cook until the
stems are transparent. When cold drain and lay them on a buttered cake
rack or wire broiler and let them remain until very dry.</p>


<p><b>PINEAPPLE MARSHMALLOWS</b>&mdash;This is a good confection for Thanksgiving.
Soak four ounces gum arabic in one cupful pineapple juice until
dissolved. Put into a granite saucepan with a half pound of powdered
sugar, and set in a larger pan of hot water over the fire. Stir until
the mixture is white and thickened. Test by dropping a little in cold
water. If it "balls," take from the fire and whip in the stiffly whipped
whites of three eggs. Flavor with a teaspoonful vanilla or orange juice,
then turn into a square pan that has been dusted with cornstarch. The
mixture should be about an inch in thickness. Stand in a cold place for
twelve hours, then cut into inch squares and roll in a mixture of
cornstarch and powdered sugar.</p>


<p><b>RAISIN FUDGE</b>&mdash;Put into a saucepan one heaped tablespoon butter, melt
and add one-half cup milk, two cups sugar, one-fourth cup molasses and
two squares chocolate grated. Boil until it is waxy when dropped into
cold water. Remove from fire, beat until creamy, then add one-half cup
each of chopped raisins and pecans. Pour into a buttered tin, and when
cool mark into squares.</p>


<p><b>SIMPLE WAY OF SUGARING FLOWERS</b>&mdash;A simple way of sugaring flowers where
they are to be used at once consists in making the customary sirup and
cooking to the crack<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> degree. Rub the inside of cups with salad oil, put
into each cup four tablespoonfuls of the flowers and sugar, let stand
until cold, turn out, and serve piled one on top of the other.</p>

spoonfuls vanilla, half cup chopped nuts, heat the berries and sugar
together, when cool mix other ingredients and freeze.</p>


<p><b>BLACK CURRANT ICE CREAM</b>&mdash;Stew one cupful black currants five minutes,
then press through a fine sieve. Add a cupful rich sirup and a cupful
thick cream, beat well, then freeze. When stiff pack in an ornamental
mold, close over and pack in ice and salt. When ready to serve turn out
on a low glass dish, garnish with crystallized cherries and leaves of
angelica.</p>


<p><b>FROZEN ICE</b>&mdash;Cook one cup of rice in boiling salted water twelve
minutes. Drain and put it in the double boiler, one quart milk, one cup
sugar and one saltspoon salt. Cook till soft, then rub through a sieve.

Cook about two minutes, or until the eggs are scalding hot, then stir
this into the rice. Add more sugar, if needed, and one tablespoonful
vanilla. Chill and pack firmly in the freezer or round the mold. Turn
out and ornament the top with fresh pineapple cut in crescent pieces or
with quartered peaches and serve a fresh fruit sirup sauce with the
cream.</p>


<p><b>FRUIT ICE</b>&mdash;Three lemons, three oranges, three bananas, three cups
sugar, three pints cold water, by pressing juice from orange and lemons,
strain well, peel banana, rub through strainer into the fruit juice, add
the sugar, then the water, stir until the sugar is dissolved, pour into
freezer. The ice that is used should be pounded until fine, and the
right kind of salt should be used.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>


<p><b>ICE CREAM WITH MAPLE SAUCE</b>&mdash;Scald one quart of cream, add one-half cup
of sugar, a bit of salt, and when cold freeze as usual, first flavoring
with vanilla or extract of ginger. Reduce some pure maple sirup by
boiling until quite thick, stir into it some sliced pecans or walnuts
and serve hot with each portion of the cream.</p>


<p><b>PINEAPPLE CREAM</b>&mdash;Two cups of water, one cup of sugar, boil fifteen
minutes, let cool, add one can grated pineapple. Freeze to mush, fold in
one-half pint of whipped cream, let stand an hour, but longer time is
better.</p>


<p><b>VANILLA ICE CREAM</b>&mdash;Put two cups of milk in a double boiler, add a
pinch of soda and scald, beat four eggs light with two cups of sugar,
pour the hot milk on slowly, stirring all the time; turn back into
double boiler and cook until a smooth custard is formed. Cool and flavor
strongly with vanilla because freezing destroys some of the strength of
flavoring. Stir in a pint of sweet cream and freeze.</p>


<p><b>CRANBERRY SHERBET</b>&mdash;This is often used at a Thanksgiving course dinner
to serve after the roast. To make it boil a quart of cranberries with
two cupfuls of water until soft, add two cupfuls sugar, stir until
dissolved, let cool, add the juice of one or two lemons and freeze. This
may be sweeter if desired. Serve in sherbet glasses.</p>

while hot slowly on to the whites of two eggs beaten stiff. Beat a few
minutes, cool, and freeze.</p>


<p><b>LEMON GINGER SHERBET</b>&mdash;This is made the same as the lemon with the
addition of four ounces of candied ginger cut in fine bits and added to
the sirup with the grated yellow rind of a lemon. Boil until clear, add
lemon juice and a little more of the rind and proceed as with the ice.</p>


<p><b>LEMON SHERBET</b>&mdash;Put two cups of sugar into four cups of water and cook

gelatin soaked in a tablespoon of cold water for fifteen minutes. Stir
one cup of lemon juice and freeze.</p>


<p><b>PINEAPPLE SORBET</b>&mdash;Peel and cut up a small sugar loaf pineapple and let
it stand in a cool place over night with a pint of sugar added to it. An
earthen jar is best for holding the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span> pineapple, whose acid properties
forbid its standing in tin. In the morning strain, pressing out as much
of the juice as possible. Add to this a pint of water and the grated
rind of an orange. Boil ten minutes, add the juice of one lemon and two
oranges, freeze about fifteen minutes until of a smooth, even,
cream-like texture, and serve after the meat course at dinner. If you
desire a granite which is frozen as hard as ice cream, but should be of
a rough-grained consistency, set the mixture away packed in ice and let
it remain there for two or three hours. Scrape the frozen part
occasionally from the sides of the can and stir long enough to mix the
ice with the mass, but not long enough to make it creamy. Serve in a cup
made of the half skin of an orange with the pulp scraped out.</p>


<p><b>TEA SHERBET</b>&mdash;Make a quart of fine flavored tea in the usual way, pour
off, sweeten to taste, add the juice of half a lemon and the fine
shredded peel, and freeze.</p>

powdered sugar, one tablespoon of rum, one teaspoon of vanilla and
one-fourth pound of macaroons broken in small pieces. Freeze the first
mixture and put in a brick mold, cover with second mixture, then repeat.
Pack in salt and ice, using two parts crushed ice to one part rock salt
and let stand two hours. Remove from mold and garnish with macaroons in
brandy.</p>


<p><b>MAPLE PARFAIT</b>&mdash;Beat four eggs slightly in a double boiler, pour in one
cup of hot maple sirup, stirring all the time. Cook until thick, cool,
and add one pint of thick cream beaten stiff. Pour into a mold and pack
in equal parts of ice and salt. Let stand three hours.</p>


<p><b>PINEAPPLE PARFAIT</b>&mdash;Cook for five minutes over the fire one cup
granulated sugar and a quarter cup of water. Beat the yolks of six eggs

constantly beating. Cook in a double boiler until the custard coats the
spoon, then strain and beat until cold. Add two cupfuls pineapple pulp
pressed through a sieve and fold in a pint of cream whipped stiff. Pack
and bury in the ice and salt mixture.</p>


<p><b>STRAWBERRY PARFAIT</b>&mdash;Hull, wash and drain some sweet strawberries.
Press through a strainer enough to give<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> about two-thirds of a cup of
pulp. Cook together in a graniteware saucepan one cupful granulated
sugar and half a cup of water until it spins a thread. Do not stir while
cooking. Whip two whites of eggs stiff and then pour the hot sirup over
them and continue beating them until the mixture is cold. As it thickens
add the crushed berries, a spoonful at a time. Have ready a pint of
cream whipped to a solid froth, stir lightly into the egg and berry
mixture, then pack into a covered mold and bury in ice and salt, equal
proportions, leaving it for several hours.</p>


<p><b>VIOLET PARFAIT</b>&mdash;This is made the same as white parfait, using
one-third cup of grape juice instead of the boiling water, and adding
half a cup of grape juice and the juice of half a lemon to the cream
before beating.</p>


<p><b>VANILLA PARFAIT</b>&mdash;Cook a half cup each sugar and water over the fire
until it threads. Do not stir after the sugar has dissolved. Beat the
whites of three eggs until very stiff, pour the sirup slowly over it,
beating constantly. Flavor with vanilla, and when cold fold in a pint of
cream whipped stiff. Pour into a mold and pack.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

freshly grated horseradish, three large stalks of celery chopped, one
cup of whole mustard seeds, one-half cup of salt, one tablespoonful each
of black pepper, cloves and cinnamon, a tablespoon of mace, one-half cup
of sugar and four quarts of vinegar. Mix all well together and put in
jars or bottles. It needs no cooking, but must stand several weeks to
ripen.</p>


<p><b>CREOLE SAUCE</b>&mdash;Scald and peel twenty-four tomatoes. Remove the seeds
from green peppers and cut the pulp and four onions fine. Shred one
ounce dried ginger, mix and add four tablespoons each of sugar and salt,
three cups of vinegar and one-half pound seedless raisins. Boil slowly
three hours, then put away in wide-mouthed bottles.</p>


<p><b>GINGERED GREEN TOMATOES</b>&mdash;To one peck small green tomatoes allow eight
onions. Slice all together and sprinkle with one cupful of salt. Let
them stand twenty-four hours, then drain and cover with fresh water.
Make a strong ginger tea, allowing one quart of boiling water to a pound
of bruised ginger root. Let it simmer gently for twenty minutes until
the strength of the ginger is extracted. Scald the chopped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span> tomatoes in
this. Drain. Mix together one ounce ground ginger, two tablespoonfuls
black pepper, two teaspoonfuls ground cloves, a quarter pound white
mustard seed, one-half cupful ground mustard, one ounce allspice, three
ounces celery seed and three pounds brown sugar. Now put the sliced
onions and tomatoes in a kettle with sugar and spices in alternate
layers, and pour over them enough white wine vinegar to cover well. Cook
the pickle until tender, then pack in jars and seal.</p>


<p><b>GREEN TOMATO MINCE</b>&mdash;To two quarts chopped apples, greenings are best,
allow two quarts chopped green tomatoes, one pound each seeded raisins
and cleaned currants, one-half nutmeg, one teaspoonful of cinnamon,
one-half teaspoonful ground cloves, six cups granulated sugar and a
cupful and a half of cider vinegar. Boil slowly three or four hours and
can.</p>


<p><b>PICALILLI</b>&mdash;Allow to one gallon sliced green tomatoes one pint grated
horseradish, eleven ounces brown sugar, two tablespoons each of fine
salt and ground mustard. Put the tomatoes in a large stone crock,
sprinkle the salt over them and let stand over night with a slight press
on top. In the morning add to the tomatoes and let stand several weeks
until it has formed its own vinegar. Always keep the pickle under the
liquor and have it in a cool place.</p>


<p><b>PEPPER RELISH</b>&mdash;Chop fine a small head of white cabbage, six large
green peppers, and a nice bunch of celery. Put in a large bowl and
sprinkle with a half cup of salt, mix well, cover and let stand over
night. Next morning drain and mix in two tablespoons of mustard seed,
and pack in a stone jar. Put in a porcelain kettle three pints of
vinegar, two tablespoons sugar, one tablespoon each of whole cloves,
allspice and whole pepper, a clove of garlic and one onion minced.
Simmer gently twenty minutes, strain and pour boiling hot over the
vegetables. When cold cover and keep in a cool place.</p>


<p><b>TOMATO CATSUP</b>&mdash;This catsup has a good relish on account of the onion
in it. Wash ripe tomatoes, cut them in slices and cook slowly for one
hour. Press through a sieve to take out the seeds and skin. To one quart
of this pulp and juice add one tablespoon of cinnamon, one of black
pepper and one of mustard, one teaspoon of cayenne, one-half cup of salt
and two onions chopped fine. Simmer two and one-half hours, then add two
cups of vinegar, cook an hour longer. Put in bottles and seal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>


<p><b>TOMATO CHUTNEY</b>&mdash;Cut up and peel twelve large tomatoes and to them add
six onions chopped fine, one cup of vinegar, one cup of sugar, a handful
of finely chopped raisins, salt to taste, a half teaspoonful of cayenne
and a half teaspoonful of white pepper. Boil one and one-half hours and
bottle or put in stone jars.</p>


<p><b>VEGETABLE RELISH</b>&mdash;Use two quarts each of cooked and finely chopped
beets and cabbage, add four cups sugar, two tablespoons salt, one
tablespoon black pepper, a half tablespoon cayenne, a cup of grated
horseradish and enough cold vinegar to cover. Bottle in glass jars and
keep in a cool place.</p>


<p><b>APPLE AND GRAPE JELLY</b>&mdash;Pull the grapes off the stems of six large
bunches, put them in a preserving kettle, just cover with water. Pare
and slice six large fall pippin apples. Put them with the grapes. When
boiled soft strain through a flannel bag. To a pint of juice allow three
quarters of a pound of sugar. Boil the juice fifteen minutes, skim and
add the sugar, which has been heated. Boil ten or fifteen minutes. This
will fill three jelly glasses.</p>


<p><b>BLACK CURRANT JELLY</b>&mdash;This is one of the best old-fashioned remedies
for sore throats, while a teaspoonful of it dissolved into a tumbler of
cold water affords a refreshing fever drink or family beverage on a hot
day. Stem large ripe black currants and after washing put into the
preserving kettle, allowing a cupful of water to each quart of fruit.
This is necessary because the black currant is drier than the red or
white. Mash with a wooden spoon or pestle, then cover and cook until the
currants have reached the boiling point and are soft. Turn into a jelly
bag and drain without squeezing. To each pint of the juice allow a half
pound loaf sugar. Stir until well mixed, then cook just ten minutes from
the time it commences to boil. Overcooking makes it tough and stringy.
Pour in sterilized glasses and when cold cover with paraffin.</p>


<p><b>CANNED PINEAPPLE</b>&mdash;Pare the pineapple and carefully remove the eyes
with a sharp-pointed silver knife. Chop or grate or shred it with a
fork, rejecting the core. Weigh, and to every pound of fruit allow a
half pound of sugar, put all together in the preserving kettle, bring
quickly to boiling, skim, and remove at once. Put into jars and fill to
overflowing with sirup, and seal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>


<p><b>CHERRY PRESERVES</b>&mdash;Select large red cherries, stem and stone them, and
save the juice. Weigh the fruit and an equal amount of sugar. Sprinkle
the sugar over the cherries and let stand six hours, then put into a
preserving kettle, add the juice, and heat slowly. Simmer until the
cherries are clear, and skim carefully several times. Seal in jars and
keep in a cool, dark place.</p>


<p><b>CRANBERRY CONSERVE</b>&mdash;To three and a half pounds cranberries add three
pounds sugar, one pound seeded raisins and four oranges, cut in small
pieces after peeling. Cook gently about twenty minutes, take from the
fire, add one pound walnut meats, and cool.</p>


<p><b>CHERRY JELLY</b>&mdash;The juice of cherries does not make a firm jelly without
the addition of gelatin. This means that it will not keep, but must be
eaten soon after making. But if a soft jelly will satisfy it can be
made, and kept like other jellies, without gelatin. To make this jelly
crush ripe cherries and cook until soft, with just enough water to keep
from burning. Strain and measure, to each cup of juice allow a cup of
sugar. Simmer the juice ten minutes, heat the sugar and drop into the
boiling juice. In a few minutes a soft jelly will form.</p>


<p><b>CRANBERRY MOLD</b>&mdash;This is an extremely pretty way of serving cranberries
in individual molds. Wash a quart of cranberries and put in a porcelain
or granite saucepan. Sprinkle over the top of the berries two cupfuls of
sugar and on top of the sugar pour one cupful cold water. Set over the
fire and cook slowly. When the berries break into a boil, cover just a
few moments, not long, or the skins will burst, then uncover and cook
until tender. Do not strain, but pour at once into small china molds.
This gives a dark rich looking mold that is not too acid and preserves
the individuality of the fruit. If you wish to use some of the
cranberries in lieu of Maraschino cherries, take up some of the most
perfect berries before they have cooked too tender, using a darning
needle or clean hat pin to impale them. Spread on an oiled plate and set
in warming oven or a sunny window until candied.</p>


<p><b>CURRANT AND RASPBERRY JELLY</b>&mdash;Some of the finest jellies and jams are
made from raspberries combined with currants. For jelly use two-thirds
of currant juice to one-third raspberry juice and finish in the usual
way.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p><b>FIG PRESERVES</b>&mdash;Take the figs when nearly ripe and cut across the top
in the form of a cross. Cover with strong salted water and let stand
three days, changing the water every day. At the end of this time cover
with fresh water, adding a few grape or fig leaves to color, and cook
until quite green. Then put again in cold water, changing twice daily,
and leave three days longer. Add a pound granulated sugar to each pound
figs, cook a few moments, take from the fire and set aside for two days.
Add more sugar to make sweet, with sliced and boiled lemon or ginger
root to flavor, and cook until tender and thick.</p>


<p><b>GREEN GRAPE MARMALADE</b>&mdash;If, as often happens, there are many unripened
grapes still on the vines and frost threatens, gather them all and try
this green grape marmalade. Take one gallon stemmed green grapes, wash,
drain and put on to cook in a porcelain kettle with one pint of water.
Cook until soft, rub through a sieve, measure and add an equal amount of
sugar to the pulp. Boil hard twenty-five minutes, watching closely that
it does not burn, then pour into jars or glasses. When cold cover with
melted paraffin, the same as for jelly.</p>


<p><b>GREEN TOMATOES CANNED FOR PIES</b>&mdash;To fifteen pounds round green tomatoes
sliced thin allow nine pounds granulated sugar and a quarter pound
ginger, washed, scraped and cut very thin, and four lemons scrubbed and
sliced thin, removing all seeds. Put this mixture over the fire with a
pint of water and cook about half an hour, taking care the contents of
the kettle do not scorch. Turn into sterilised glass jars and seal air
tight. A tablespoonful of cinnamon and a half tablespoonful each of
cloves and allspice may be added to the sauce while cooking if desired.</p>


<p><b>PEAR AND BLUEBERRY PRESERVES</b>&mdash;Pick over and wash two quarts of
blueberries, add water to nearly cover and stew them half hour. Mash
them well, when all are broken turn into a bowl covered with cheese
cloth. Drain well and when cool squeeze out all the juice. Put the
blueberry juice on to boil, add one pint of sugar to each pint of juice
and remove all scum. Allow one quart of sliced pears to one pint of
juice. Use hard pears not suitable for canning. Cook them in the syrup,
turning over often and when soft and transparent skim them out into the
jars. Boil down the syrup and strain over the fruit. Fill to overflowing
and seal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>


<p><b>PRESERVED CURRANTS</b>&mdash;Weigh seven pounds of currants before picking
over, then stem them and throw out all that are not perfect. Put seven
pounds of sugar with three pints of currant juice and boil three
minutes, add the currants, one pound of seeded raisins, and cook all
twenty minutes. Seal in small jars.</p>


<p><b>PRESERVED STRAWBERRIES</b>&mdash;The following method for preserving
strawberries is highly recommended. Weigh the berries and allow an equal
amount of sugar. As two cups weigh a pound, the sugar can be measured.
Put the sugar into the preserving kettle with enough cold water to
moisten it, but not enough to make it a liquid. Set the kettle on the
back of the range, and when the sugar has entirely dissolved lay in the
fruit and heat. As soon as it boils skim and cook five minutes. Do not
stir or mash the berries. Now spread them around on deep platters or
enameled pans and cover with panes of window glass. Set in the sun, and
the syrup will gradually thicken. Turn into small jars and seal.</p>


<p><b>RHUBARB JAM</b>&mdash;Add to each pound of rhubarb cut without peeling, a pound
of sugar and one lemon. Pare the yellow peel from the lemon, taking care
to get none of the bitter white pith. Slice the pulp of the lemon in an
earthen bowl, discarding the seeds. Put the rhubarb into the bowl with
the sugar and lemon, cover and stand away in a cool place over night. In
the morning turn into the preserving kettle, simmer gently
three-quarters of an hour or until thick, take from the fire, cool a
little and pour into jars.</p>


<p><b>SPICED CRABAPPLES</b>&mdash;Wash the crabapples, cut out the blossoms end with
a silver knife. To four pounds of fruit take two pounds of sugar, one
pint of vinegar, one heaping teaspoon each of broken cinnamon, cassia
buds and allspice, add one scant tablespoon whole cloves. Tie the spices
in a thin bag and boil with the vinegar and sugar five minutes. Skim
them, add the apples and simmer slowly until tender; which will take
about ten or fifteen minutes. Skim out the apples, putting them in a
large bowl or jar. Boil the sugar five minutes longer and pour over the
fruit. Next day drain off the syrup, heat to the boiling point and pour
again over the apples. Do this for the next two days, then bottle and
seal while hot.</p>


<p><b>SPICED CRABAPPLE JELLY</b>&mdash;With crabapples still on hand a nice spiced
jelly can be made to serve with meats. Cook the apples without peeling
until tender. Strain through a jelly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> bag, add vinegar to taste with
cloves and cinnamon. Cook twenty minutes, add an equal quantity of sugar
that has been heated in the oven. Boil five minutes, skim and turn in
glasses.</p>


<p><b>SPICED RIPE TOMATO</b>&mdash;Peel ripe tomatoes and weigh. For each seven
pounds allow two cups of vinegar, seven cups of sugar, one ounce of
whole allspice, the same of stick cinnamon and one-half ounce of whole
cloves. Cook the tomatoes half an hour or until soft, cutting to pieces
while cooking. Add the vinegar, sugar and spices tied in a muslin bag.
Cook until thick like marmalade. Serve with cold meats.</p>


<p><b>TOMATO FIGS</b>&mdash;Scald eight pounds of yellow tomatoes and remove the
skins. Pack them in layers with an equal weight of sugar. After
twenty-four hours drain off the juice and simmer five minutes, add the
tomatoes and boil until clear. Remove the fruit with a skimmer and
harden in the sun while you boil down the syrup until thick; pack jars
two-thirds full of the tomatoes, pour the syrup over and seal. Add the
juice of four lemons, two ounces of green ginger root tied up in a bag
and the parboiled yellow rind of the lemons to the juice when boiling
down.</p>


<p><b>WILD GRAPE BUTTER</b>&mdash;If the wild frost grapes are used, take them after
the frost has ripened them. Stem and mash, then mix with an equal
quantity of stewed and mashed apple. Rub the mixture through a sieve,
add half as much sugar as there is pulp and cook until thick, being
careful that it does not burn. It is a good idea to set preserves and
fruit butters in the oven with the door ajar to finish cooking as there
is then much less danger of burning or spattering.</p>


<p><b>YELLOW TOMATO PRESERVES</b>&mdash;Allow a pound sugar to each pound tomatoes
and half cup of water to each pound fruit. Cover the tomatoes with
boiling water, then skim. Make a syrup with the sugar, and when boiling
skim and add the tomatoes. Have ready a sliced lemon that has been
cooked in boiling water and a little sliced ginger. Add to the tomatoes.
Cook until the tomatoes are clear, remove, pack in jars, cook the syrup
until thick, pour over and seal.</p>


<p><b>MINCE MEAT</b>&mdash;One peck sour apples, three pounds boiled beef, two pounds
suet, one quart canned cherries, one quart grape juice, one pint cider,
one pint apple butter, one glass orange marmalade, half pound candied
orange peel, half pound citron, two pounds currants, two pounds raisins,
two tablespoonfuls salt. Put all together and boil up well. This may be
canned for future use.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="SOUFFLES" id="SOUFFLES"></a>SOUFFLES</h2>


<p><b>ASPARAGUS SOUFFLE</b>&mdash;Only very tender asparagus should be used. Cut it
fine and boil tender in salted water. Add the well beaten yolks of four
eggs, one tablespoonful of soft butter, a saltspoon of salt and a little
pepper. Then fold in the stiffly beaten whites of the eggs and bake in a
steady oven. Canned asparagus can be substituted for fresh.</p>


<p><b>CABBAGE SOUFFLE</b>&mdash;Chop a solid white head of cabbage and cook in salted
water until tender. Drain and place in a buttered dish in layers with a
sprinkling of grated cheese between. Mix two tablespoonfuls each of
flour and butter, add one cupful of rich milk, the beaten yolks of two
eggs and a saltspoon of salt and mustard, stir over the fire until it
boils. Then add the stiffly beaten whites of the eggs, pour over the
cabbage and bake for half an hour.</p>


<p><b>CHEESE SOUFFLE</b>&mdash;Mix together one-half cup breadcrumbs, a quarter
teaspoon salt, a half teaspoonful mustard and a dash of cayenne. Add a
tablespoonful butter, a cup and a half milk and cook over hot water.
When heated remove. Add while hot two cups grated cheese and the well
beaten yolks of three eggs. Cool. When ready to bake add the beaten
whites of four eggs and a cup of whipped cream. Fill individual cups
half full, set in a pan of hot water and bake fifteen minutes in a quick
oven.</p>


<p><b>CORN SOUFFLE</b>&mdash;To one pint of sweet grated corn (canned corn) drain and
run through a food chopper (may be used), add the well beaten yolks of
two eggs, one pint of sweet milk, one small teaspoonful of salt, one and
one-half tablespoonfuls of sugar and the stiffly beaten whites of the
eggs. Mix well and bake in a buttered casserole or ramequins for forty
minutes.</p>


<p><b>GUERNSEY CHEESE SOUFFLE</b>&mdash;Pin a narrow folded paper thoroughly buttered
on the inside, around six or eight ramequins and butter the ramequins
thoroughly. Melt two tablespoonfuls butter and in it cook two
tablespoonfuls of flour and a quarter teaspoonful each of salt and
paprika. When the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> mixture looks frothy stir in half a cup of milk and
stir until boiling. Then add four ounces grated cheese and the beaten
yolks of three eggs. Lastly fold in the stiffly whipped whites of three
eggs. Put the mixture into the ramequins letting it come up to the paper
or nearly to the top of the dishes. Set the ramequins on many folds of
paper in a dish, pour in boiling water to half fill, and let bake in a
moderate oven until the mixture is well puffed up and firm to the touch.
Remove the buttered paper, set the ramequins in place and serve at once.
A green vegetable salad seasoned with French dressing and a browned
cracker may accompany the dish.</p>


<p><b>SOUFFLE OF CARROTS</b>&mdash;Boil the carrots and mash them fine, add a little
sugar to taste, a pinch of salt, a spoonful of flour and a good lump of
butter, the well beaten yolks of four eggs, and lastly fold in the
stiffly beaten whites. Bake in a quick oven in the dish in which it may
be served.</p>

<h2><a name="FILLING_FOR_CAKES" id="FILLING_FOR_CAKES"></a>FILLING FOR CAKES</h2>


<p><b>COFFEE CREAM FOR CHARLOTTE AND ECLAIR</b>&mdash;Flavor one pint of rich thick
cream with one-fourth cup of black coffee and one teaspoon of lemon, add
about a half a cup of sugar, chill and whip it until thick enough to
stand. Pour it into molds lined with thin sponge cake or lady fingers.
Fill them level and ornament the top with some of the cream forced
through tube.</p>


<p><b>FILLING</b>&mdash;For the filling scald one cup of milk with three level
tablespoons of ground coffee and let stand where it will be hot but not
boil, for five minutes. Strain, add one-half cup of sugar, three level
tablespoons of flour and a pinch of salt. Cook in a double boiler
fifteen minutes, add one beaten egg and cook two minutes, stirring to
keep smooth. Cool and add one-quarter teaspoon of vanilla flavoring.
Fill the cream cakes and cover with cream beaten thick, sweetened with
powdered sugar and flavored with a few drops of vanilla.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>


<p><b>FILLING FOR CAKE</b>&mdash;Soak a level tablespoon of gelatin in one tablespoon
of cold water for half an hour, add one tablespoon of boiling water and
stir. Beat one pint of cream stiff, then beat in the soaked gelatin, add
powdered sugar to make sweet and a small teaspoon vanilla flavoring or
enough to suit the taste. Put this filling in thick layers between the
cakes and cover the top one with a white icing.</p>


<p><b>FIG OR DATE FROSTING</b>&mdash;These frostings are excellent to use upon any
kind of cake, but as they are rather rich in themselves, they seem
better suited for light white cake. If figs are preferred they should be
chopped fine. If dates, the stones and as much as possible of the white
lining should be removed and then they should be chopped fine. For a
good size loaf of cake, baked in two layers, use a scant quarter of a
pound of either the chopped dates or figs, put into a double boiler or
saucepan with a very little boiling water, just enough to make the mass
pliable. Let them stand and heat while the syrup is boiling. For this
two cups of fine granulated sugar and half a cup of boiling water are
required. Boil without stirring till the syrup taken upon the spoon or
skewer will "thread." Do not allow it to boil too hard at first. When
the sugar is thoroughly melted, move the saucepan to a hotter part of
the stove so that it may boil more vigorously. Have ready the whites of
two eggs beaten dry, now to them add the fig or date paste and pour the
boiling syrup in a fine stream over the two, beating all the time. Beat
occasionally while cooling, and when thoroughly cold add one teaspoonful
of lemon extract, and it is ready for use. These frostings may be a
trifle sticky the day they are made, especially if the syrup is not
boiled very long, but the stickiness disappears by the second day, even
if kept in a stone jar.</p>


<p><b>LEMON JELLY</b>&mdash;Grate two lemons, add the juice, one cup of white sugar,
one large spoonful of butter and the yolks of three eggs. Stir
constantly over the fire until it jellies, when cold spread between
cakes.</p>


<p><b>MAPLE ICING</b>&mdash;Scrape half a pound of maple sugar and melt, add two
tablespoons of boiling water. While hot pour over the cake. Be sure to
melt the sugar before adding the water.</p>


<p><b>MOCHA FILLING AND ICING</b>&mdash;A rich but much liked filling for small cakes
is made by boiling one cup of sugar and one-half cup of very strong or
very black coffee together until the syrup will thread. In the meantime
wash one cup of sweet but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>ter in cold water to take out all the salt.
Put in a piece of cheesecloth and pat it until all the moisture is dried
out. Beat until creamy, adding slowly the beaten yolk of one egg and the
syrup. Spread this filling between layer cakes, but it is more often
used to pipe over the top of small cakes.</p>


<p><b>ORANGE FILLING</b>&mdash;One-half cup of sugar, two and one-half level
tablespoons flour, grated rind of one-half orange, one-third cup of
orange juice, one tablespoon lemon juice, one egg beaten slightly, one
teaspoon melted butter. Mix the ingredients and cook in double boiler
for twelve minutes, stirring constantly. Cool before using.</p>

<h2><a name="DESSERTS" id="DESSERTS"></a>DESSERTS</h2>


<p><b>APPLES STUFFED WITH DATES</b>&mdash;Core large, slightly acid apples and fill
with stoned dates. Pour over them equal parts of sugar and water boiled
together. Baste the apples frequently while baking. Serve as a dessert
at dinner or luncheon.</p>


<p><b>APPLE SPONGE PUDDING</b>&mdash;One cup of sifted pastry flour and sift it with
one level teaspoon of baking-powder. Beat the yolks of three eggs until
light colored, add one cup of sugar and the juice of one lemon. Fold in
the stiffly beaten whites of the three eggs and then the flour. Spread
the batter thinly on a large shallow pan and bake about twenty minutes
in a moderate oven. Turn out of the pan, trim off any hard edges, spread
with stewed, sweetened, and flavored apples, and roll up at once like a
jelly roll. Serve with a liquid sauce or a syrup made from sugar and
water.</p>


<p><b>APRICOT KISSES</b>&mdash;Beat the whites of two eggs until very light and
still, flavor with one-half teaspoon vanilla and then carefully fold in
one cup of fine granulated sugar. Lay a sheet of paraffin paper over the
bottom of a large baking part and drop the mixture on the paper, in any
size you wish from one teaspoon to two tablespoons. Have them some
distance apart so they will not run together. Bake them in a very
moderate oven and be careful to bake sufficiently, say forty-five
minutes. They should be only delicately colored and yet dry all through.
When done remove to a platter and break the top in, remove a little of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
the inside and fill pulp of sifted peaches, sweetened and mixed with
equal parts of whipped cream. Sprinkle pistachio nuts over the top and
serve fancy cakes.</p>


<p><b>BAKED CUSTARD</b>&mdash;Beat four eggs, whites and yolks together lightly, and
add a quart of milk, four tablespoons sugar, a pinch of salt and
flavoring. Bake in stoneware cups or a shallow bowl, set in a pan of
water.</p>


<p><b>BAKED BANANAS, PORTO RICAN FASHION</b>&mdash;Select rather green bananas, put
them, without removing the skins, into hot ashes or a very hot oven and
bake until the skins burst open. Send to the table in a folded napkin.
The skins help hold in the heat and are not to be removed until the
moment of eating. Serve plenty of butter with them.</p>


<p><b>BANANA AND LEMON JELLY CREAM</b>&mdash;Soak one-half box of gelatin in one cup
of cold water. Shave the rind of one lemon, using none of the white, and
steep it with one square inch stick of cinnamon in one pint of boiling
water ten minutes. Add the soaked gelatin, one cup of sugar and
three-fourths of a cup of lemon juice, and when dissolved strain into
shallow dishes. When cold cut it in dice or break it up with a fork, and
put it in a glass dish in layers with spiced bananas. Pour a cold boiled
custard over them and cover with a meringue. Brown the meringue on a
plate and slip it off over the custard.</p>


<p><b>CUSTARD PUDDING</b>&mdash;Line a baking dish with slices of sponge cake. Make a
boiled custard with four cups of milk and the yolks of five eggs,
one-half cup of sugar and flavored with vanilla. Pour the custard into
the baking-dish. Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth with
one-half cup of powdered sugar and spread over the top. Set in a very
slow oven to brown slightly.</p>


<p><b>CUSTARD SOUFFLE</b>&mdash;Mix one-fourth cup of sugar, one cup flour and one
cup of cold milk. Stir till it thickens, add one-fourth cup of butter,
cool, stir in the beaten yolks of four eggs and then the stiffly beaten
whites. Turn into a buttered shallow dish, set in a pan of hot water and
bake in a moderate oven half an hour. Serve at once.</p>


<p><b>FIG AND RHUBARB</b>&mdash;Wash two bunches of rhubarb and cut into inch pieces
without peeling. Put into boiler with a cupful sugar and four or five
figs cut in inch pieces. Put on the cover and cook over hot water until
the rhubarb is tender and the syrup is rich and jelly-like in
consistency. Raisins are nice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> cooked in rhubarb the same way. If
preferred, and you are to have a hot oven anyway, put the rhubarb and

cornmeal, one quart scalded milk, half cup molasses, two tablespoons
butter, one-half teaspoon salt, one teaspoon ginger and cinnamon mixed,
one cup cold milk. Soak the tapioca in cold water for one hour, then

the top and bake for one hour in a moderate oven.</p>


<p><b>LEMON MERINGUE PUDDING</b>&mdash;Soak one cup of fine breadcrumbs in two cups
of milk until soft. Beat one-quarter cup of butter and one-half of sugar
together until greasy, stir all into the milk and crumbs. Grate a little
yellow lemon peel over the top and pour into a buttered baking dish. Set
in a moderate oven until firm and slightly browned. Make a meringue of
the stiffly beaten whites of two eggs and four level tablespoons of
powdered sugar. Spread over the pudding, return to the oven and color a
little.</p>


<p><b>LEMON PUDDING</b>&mdash;Three eggs, one scant cup sugar, one lemon juice and
rind, two cups of milk, two liberal tablespoons cornstarch, one heaping
teaspoon butter. Scald the milk and stir in the cornstarch, stirring all

molasses, half a teaspoonful salt and a tablespoonful ginger. Beat the
mixture until smooth, and lastly turn in a quart of cold milk, stirring
very little. Pour into a well greased pudding-dish and set in a very
slow oven. This pudding needs about five hours of very slow baking to
insure its becoming creamy, instead of hard and lumpy. The batter, after
the cold milk is added should be about the consistency of pancake
batter. Serve with cream or maple syrup.</p>


<p><b>ORANGE PUDDING</b>&mdash;Take one cup of fine stale breadcrumbs, not dried, and
moisten them with as much milk as they will absorb and become thoroughly
softened. Beat the yolks of four eggs with the whites of two, add four
tablespoons of sugar and the grated peel of one orange, using of course
only the outer cells. Stir this into the softened crumbs, then beat the
other two whites until stiff and fold them into the mixture. Turn it

berries and they are good round shape. Tie the ends of the cloth firmly,
drop them into boiling water and cook twenty minutes. Remove the cloth
and serve with lemon sauce.</p>


<p><b>SPOON PUDDING</b>&mdash;Cream one tablespoonful butter with two tablespoonfuls

cheese cloth until dry and then roiled in flour before adding. Pour into
a pudding mold, and steam one and one-quarter hours. Serve with liquid
sauce.</p>


<p><b>STEAMED PUDDING</b>&mdash;Beat one-half cup of butter with one cup of sugar to
a cream, add two beaten eggs and cup of flour sifted with one teaspoon
each of cinnamon and soda, two cups of breadcrumbs, soaked in one cup of

golden yellow.</p>


<p><b>TAPIOCA PUDDING</b>&mdash;Cover one cup of the flake tapioca with cold water
and let it stand two hours. Stir occasionally with a fork to separate
the lumps. Put in a farina kettle with a pint and a half water.</p>

<p>Slice three tart apples and put in with the tapioca, together with sugar
to sweeten to taste. Stir all together and cook until the apples are
soft and the tapioca clear. Serve hot or cold. Peaches may be used in
place of the apple. Serve with cream.</p>


<p><b>TAPIOCA SOUFFLE</b>&mdash;Soak three tablespoonfuls pearl tapioca in water to
cover for three or four hours. Then add a quart of milk and cook until
the tapioca is perfectly clear and the milk thickened. It will take
about twenty minutes, and unless you use the farina kettle, must be
stirred constantly. Add the yolks of four eggs beaten with two-thirds
cup sugar and cook two or three minutes, stirring steadily. Whip the
whites of four eggs to a stiff froth, fold through the cooked cream, and
take directly from the fire. Flavor with lemon or vanilla and bake in a

<p><b>FRUIT SYRUP SAUCE</b>&mdash;One cup fruit syrup, one-half cup sugar, one
teaspoon butter. Use the syrup from apricots, peaches, cherries, quinces
or any fruit you prefer. The amount of sugar will depend upon the
acidity of the fruit. Mix the cornstarch with the sugar, add the syrup
and boil all together five minutes. Add the butter last.</p>


<p><b>LEMON SAUCE</b>&mdash;Grate the rind and squeeze the juice of one lemon. Mix

stir quickly as it thickens. When it is smooth set it back where it will
simply bubble and simmer, and stir occasionally. Add the grated rind and
juice of one lemon and one rounding tablespoon butter. If this is too
thick add more hot water as it thickens in cooling, and you want it thin
enough to pour easily.</p>


<p><b>LEMON SAUCE</b>&mdash;Mix three tablespoons of cornstarch with one cup of cold
water and turn on one cup of boiling water. Boil ten minutes, then add
one cup of sugar, the juice and grated yellow rind of one lemon and two

into one cup of sugar and turn into two cups of boiling water. Cook ten
minutes, add a pinch of salt, the orange rind and juice, stir and
strain.</p>


<p><b>RASPBERRY SAUCE FOR ICE CREAM</b>&mdash;If you think that a good ice cream is
yet not quite fine enough, pour a raspberry sauce over each portion as
served. Add one-quarter cup of sugar to one cup of raspberry juice
prepared as for jelly-making, and simmer five minutes. Add a rounding
teaspoon of arrow-root made smooth in one tablespoon of cold water, and
cook five minutes. Now add one tablespoon of strained lemon juice and
let boil up once.</p>


<p><b>SAUCE FOR CHERRY PUDDING</b>&mdash;Put two cups of cherry juice, or juice and

<h2><a name="BEVERAGES" id="BEVERAGES"></a>BEVERAGES</h2>


<p><b>COCOA WITH WHIPPED CREAM</b>&mdash;Heat four cups of milk to the scalding point
over hot water, or in a double boiler. Milk should be heated by direct
contact with the fire. Mix a few grains of salt, three level tablespoons
of cocoa and one-fourth cup of sugar to a paste with a little of the
milk, then add three-fourths cup of boiling water and boil one minute,
add to the hot milk and beat two minutes by the clock. Serve with a
tablespoon of beaten or whipped cream on top of each cup.</p>


<p><b>CURRANT JULEP</b>&mdash;Pick over currants and measure two cups. Mash them and
pour on two cups of cold water. Strain and chill the juice. Put one
tablespoon of simple syrup in a tall glass, add three bruised fresh mint
leaves and fill with the currant juice. Add three or four perfect
raspberries and serve. The syrup is made by simmering for twenty
minutes, one cup of sugar and two of water.</p>


<p><b>CURRANT SHRUB</b>&mdash;Pick over and mash two quarts of ripe currants, add one
pint of vinegar, and let stand over night. Set on the range and bring to
the boiling point, then strain twice. Measure the clear liquid, and
allow one cup of sugar to each cup of liquid. Simmer twenty minutes and
seal in bottles.</p>


<p><b>RASPBERRY SHRUB</b>&mdash;Put one quart of ripe raspberries in a bowl, add two
cups of vinegar, mash the berries slightly, and let stand over night. In
the morning, scald and strain until clear. Measure, and to each cup of
juice add one cup of sugar, boil twenty minutes and seal.</p>


<p><b>STRAWBERRY SYRUP</b>&mdash;Pick over, rinse, drain and remove the hulls from
several quarts of ripe berries. Fill a porcelain lined double boiler
with the fruit and set it over the lower boiler half full of boiling
water, and let it heat until the juice flows freely. Mash the berries,
then turn out into a cloth strainer and cook the remainder of the fruit
in the same way. When all the juice is pressed out, measure it and allow
an equal amount of sugar. Let the juice come to the boiling point, add
the sugar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> and cook five minutes from the time the whole begins to boil.
Turn into jars or bottles and seal the same as canned fruit. This is
excellent for beverages, flavoring ice cream and other fancy creams, and
will be found desirable for many purposes when fresh fruit is not at
hand.</p>

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
